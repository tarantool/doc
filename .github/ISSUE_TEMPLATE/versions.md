# Merge version 2.x.y into latest

# What needs to be done

**Reviewer:** @NickVolynkin

# Definition of done

- [ ] For each element in version's changelog add a "Read more" link to the docs.
- [ ] In the target docs make a "Since version 2.x.y" statement
      with link back to release notes.
- [ ] When there are alternatives for the same action,
      move forward the one which is implemented in a later version.


# Planning checklist

- [ ] Add to Documentation board
- [ ] Add milestone "Merge 2.x branches"
- [ ] Evaluate in storypoints
