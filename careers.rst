                  for one of our partners either full time or on a piecework basis.
                </p>
                <p>The certificate is issued following a successful in-person interview, based on an undisclosed scoring system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The procedure is completely free. The certificate is valid for one year from the issuance date. Being a certified Tarantool
                  developer gives you a chance to get hired by one of our partners, either by directly contacting them or through
                  our assistance. Some of our partners are currently willing to employ such specialists. After receiving the
                  certificate, you may ask us to negotiate, on your behalf, your desired salary or hourly rate with a prospective
                  employer. We’ll recommend that our partner pay you a specified amount. This process is totally free and transparent.
                </p>
