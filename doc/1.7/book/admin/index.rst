Tarantool is designed to have multiple running instances on the same host. 

Here we show how to administer Tarantool instances using any of the following
utilities:

* ``systemd`` native utilities, or
* :ref:`tarantoolctl <tarantoolctl>`, a utility shipped and installed as
  part of Tarantool distribution.

.. NOTE::

   * Unlike the rest of this manual, here we use system-wide paths.
   * Console examples here are for Fedora.
