Preface
===============================================================================

Welcome to Tarantool! This is the User's Guide. We recommend reading it first,
and consulting :ref:`Reference <reference>` materials for more detail afterwards,
if needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to read the documentation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get started, you can install and launch Tarantool using
:ref:`a Docker container <getting_started-using_docker>`,
:ref:`a binary package <getting_started-using_binary>`,
or the online Tarantool server at http://try.tarantool.org.
Either way, as the first tryout, you can follow the introductory exercises
from :ref:`Chapter 2 "Getting started" <getting_started>`.
If you want more hands-on experience, proceed to :ref:`Tutorials <tutorials>`
after you are through with Chapter 2.

:ref:`Chapter 3 "Database" <database-chapter>` is about using Tarantool
as a NoSQL DBMS, whereas :ref:`Chapter 4 "Application server" <app_server>`
is about using Tarantool as an application server.

:ref:`Chapter 5 "Server administration" <admin>` and
:ref:`Chapter 6 "Replication" <replication>` are primarily for administrators.

:ref:`Chapter 7 "Connectors" <index-box_connectors>` is strictly for users who
are connecting from a different language such as C or Perl or Python â€” other
users will find no immediate need for this chapter.

:ref:`Chapter 8 "FAQ" <faq>` gives answers to some frequently asked questions
about Tarantool.

For experienced users, there are also :ref:`Reference <reference>` materials,
a :ref:`Contributor's Guide <contrib_guide>` and an extensive set of comments
in the source code.
