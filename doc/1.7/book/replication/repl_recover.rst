Recovering from a degraded state
================================================================================

"Degraded state" is a situation when the master becomes unavailable -- due to
hardware or network failure, or due to a programming bug.

In a master-replica set, if a master disappears, error messages appear on the
replicas stating that the connection is lost:

.. code-block:: console

   $ # messages from a replica's log

... and the master's status is reported as "disconnected":

To declare that one of the replicas must now take over as a new master:

1. Make sure that the old master is gone for good:

   * change network routing rules to avoid any more packets being delivered to
     the master, or
   * shut down the master instance, if you have access to the machine, or
   * power off the container or the machine.

2. Say ``box.cfg{read_only=false, listen=URI}`` on the replica, and
   ``box.cfg{replication=URI}`` on the other replicas in the set.

.. NOTE::

   If there are updates on the old master that were not propagated before the
   old master went down,
   :ref:`re-apply them manually <admin-disaster_recovery-master_replica>` to the
   new master using ``tarantoolctl cat`` and ``tarantoolctl play`` commands.

There is no automatic way for a replica to detect that the master is gone
forever, since sources of failure and replication environments vary
significantly. So the detection of degraded state requires an external observer.
