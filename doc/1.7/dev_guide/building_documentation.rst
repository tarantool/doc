Building documentation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tarantool documentation is built using a simplified markup system named ``Sphinx``
(see http://sphinx-doc.org). You can build a local version of this documentation
and you can contribute to Tarantool's version.

You need to install these packages:

* ``git`` (a program for downloading source repositories)
* ``CMake`` version 2.8 or later (a program for managing the build process)
* ``Python`` version greater than 2.6 -- preferably 2.7 -- and less than 3.0
  (Sphinx is a Python-based tool)
* ``LaTeX`` (a system for document preparation; the installable
  package name usually begins with the word 'texlive' or 'tetex', on Ubuntu
  the name is 'texlive-latex-base')
* ``ImageMagick`` (a system for image conversion; on MacOS install it using
  ``brew``)

You need to install these Python modules:

* `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_, any version
* `Sphinx <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Sphinx>`_ version 1.4.4 or later
* `sphinx-intl <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinx-intl>`_ version 0.9.9
* `lupa <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lupa>`_ -- any version

See more details about installation in the :ref:`build-from-source <building_from_source>`
section of this documentation.

1. Use ``git`` to download the latest source code of this documentation from the
   GitHub repository ``tarantool/doc``, branch 1.7. For example, to download to a local
   directory named ``~/tarantool-doc``:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ git clone https://github.com/tarantool/doc.git ~/tarantool-doc

2. Use ``CMake`` to initiate the build.

   .. code-block:: console

       $ cd ~/tarantool-doc
       $ make clean         # unnecessary, added for good luck
       $ rm CMakeCache.txt  # unnecessary, added for good luck
       $ cmake .            # initiate

3. Build a local version of the documentation.

   Run the ``make`` command with an appropriate option to specify which
   documentation version to build.

   .. code-block:: console

       $ cd ~/tarantool-doc
       $ make sphinx-html           # multi-page English version
       $ make sphinx-singlehtml     # one-page English version
       $ make sphinx-html-ru        # multi-page Russian version
       $ make sphinx-singlehtml-ru  # one-page Russian version
       $ make all                   # all versions plus the entire web-site

   Documentation will be created in subdirectories of ``/output``:

   * ``/output/en`` (files of the English version)
   * ``/output/ru`` (files of the Russian version)

   The entry point for each version is the ``index.html`` file in the appropriate
   directory.

4. Set up a web-server.

   Run the following command to set up a web-server. The example below is for
   Ubuntu, but the procedure is similar for other supported operating systems.
   Make sure to run it from the documentation output folder,
   ``output/en`` or ``output/ru``, as in the example below:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ cd ~/tarantool-doc/output/en
       $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

5. Open your browser and enter ``127.0.0.1:8000/doc/1.7`` into the address box. If
   your local documentation build is valid, the manual will appear in the browser.

6. To contribute to documentation, use the ``.rst`` format for drafting and
   submit your updates as a
   `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/>`_
   via GitHub.

   To comply with the writing and formatting style, use the
   :ref:`guidelines <documentation_guidelines>` provided in the documentation,
   common sense and existing documents.

.. NOTE::

   * If you suggest creating a new documentation section (a whole new
     page), it has to be saved to the relevant section at GitHub.

   * If you want to contribute to localizing this documentation (for example into
     Russian), add your translation strings to ``.po`` files stored in the
     corresponding locale directory (for example ``/locale/ru/LC_MESSAGES/``
     for Russian). See more about localizing with Sphinx at
     http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/intl.html
