Data persistence and the WAL file format
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To maintain data persistence, Tarantool writes each data change request (insert,
update, delete, replace, upsert) into a write-ahead log (WAL) file in the
:ref:`wal_dir <cfg_basic-wal_dir>` directory. A new WAL file is created for every
:ref:`rows_per_wal <cfg_binary_logging_snapshots-rows_per_wal>` records.
Each data change request gets assigned a continuously growing 64-bit log sequence
number. The name of the WAL file is based on the log sequence number of the first
record in the file, plus an extension ``.xlog``.

Apart from a log sequence number and the data change request (formatted as in
:ref:`Tarantool's binary protocol <box_protocol-iproto_protocol>`),
each WAL record contains a header, some metadata, and then the data formatted
according to `msgpack <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MessagePack>`_ rules.
For example, this is what the WAL file looks like after the first INSERT request
("s:insert({1})") for the sandbox database created in our
:ref:`"Getting started" exercises <getting_started>`.

A tool for reading .xlog files is Tarantool's :ref:`xlog module <xlog>`.

Tarantool processes requests atomically: a change is either accepted and recorded
in the WAL, or discarded completely. Let's clarify how this happens, using the
REPLACE request as an example:

1. The server instance attempts to locate the original tuple by primary key. If found, a
   reference to the tuple is retained for later use.

2. The new tuple is validated. If for example it does not contain an indexed
   field, or it has an indexed field whose type does not match the type
   according to the index definition, the change is aborted.

3. The new tuple replaces the old tuple in all existing indexes.

4. A message is sent to the writer process running in the WAL thread, requesting that
   the change be recorded in the WAL. The instance switches to work on the next
   request until the write is acknowledged.

5. On success, a confirmation is sent to the client. On failure, a rollback
   procedure is begun. During the rollback procedure, the transaction processor
   rolls back all changes to the database which occurred after the first failed
   change, from latest to oldest, up to the first failed change. All rolled back
   requests are aborted with :errcode:`ER_WAL_IO <ER_WAL_IO>` error. No new
   change is applied while rollback is in progress. When the rollback procedure
   is finished, the server restarts the processing pipeline.

One advantage of the described algorithm is that complete request pipelining is
achieved, even for requests on the same value of the primary key. As a result,
database performance doesn't degrade even if all requests refer to the same
key in the same space.

The transaction processor thread communicates with the WAL writer thread using
asynchronous (yet reliable) messaging; the transaction processor thread, not
being blocked on WAL tasks, continues to handle requests quickly even at high
volumes of disk I/O. A response to a request is sent as soon as it is ready,
even if there were earlier incomplete requests on the same connection. In
particular, SELECT performance, even for SELECTs running on a connection packed
with UPDATEs and DELETEs, remains unaffected by disk load.

The WAL writer employs a number of durability modes, as defined in configuration
variable :ref:`wal_mode <index-wal_mode>`. It is possible to turn the write-ahead
log completely off, by setting
:ref:`wal_mode <cfg_binary_logging_snapshots-wal_mode>` to *none*. Even
without the write-ahead log it's still possible to take a persistent copy of the
entire data set with the :ref:`box.snapshot() <box-snapshot>` request.

An .xlog file always contains changes based on the primary key.
Even if the client requested an update or delete using
a secondary key, the record in the .xlog file will contain the primary key.

.. _internals-snapshot:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The snapshot file format
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The format of a snapshot .snap file is nearly the same as the format of a WAL .xlog file.
However, the snapshot header differs: it contains the instance's global unique identifier
and the snapshot file's position in history, relative to earlier snapshot files.
Also, the content differs: an .xlog file may contain records for any data-change
requests (inserts, updates, upserts, and deletes), a .snap file may only contain records
of inserts to memtx spaces.

Primarily, the .snap file's records are ordered by space id. Therefore the records of
system spaces -- such as ``_schema``, ``_space``, ``_index``, ``_func``, ``_priv``
and ``_cluster`` -- will be at the start of the .snap file, before the records of
any spaces that were created by users.

Secondarily, the .snap file's records are ordered by primary key within space id.

.. _internals-recovery_process:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The recovery process
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The recovery process begins when box.cfg{} happens for the
first time after the Tarantool server instance starts.

The recovery process must recover the databases
as of the moment when the instance was last shut down. For this it may
use the latest snapshot file and any WAL files that were written
after the snapshot. One complicating factor is that Tarantool
has two engines -- the memtx data must be reconstructed entirely
from the snapshot and the WAL files, while the vinyl data will
be on disk but might require updating around the time of a checkpoint.
(When a snapshot happens, Tarantool tells the vinyl engine to
make a checkpoint, and the snapshot operation is rolled back if
anything goes wrong, so vinyl's checkpoint is at least as fresh
as the snapshot file.)

Step 1
    Read the configuration parameters in the ``box.cfg{}`` request.
    Parameters which affect recovery may include :ref:`work_dir <cfg_basic-work_dir>`,
    :ref:`wal_dir <cfg_basic-wal_dir>`, :ref:`memtx_dir <cfg_basic-memtx_dir>`,
    :ref:`vinyl_dir <cfg_basic-vinyl_dir>`
    and :ref:`force_recovery <cfg_binary_logging_snapshots-force_recovery>`.

Step 2
    Find the latest snapshot file. Use its data to reconstruct the in-memory
    databases. Instruct the vinyl engine to recover to the latest checkpoint.

    There are actually two variations of the reconstruction procedure for memtx
    databases, depending on whether the recovery process is "default".

    If the recovery process is default (``force_recovery`` is ``false``),
    memtx can read data in the snapshot with all indexes disabled.
    First, all tuples are read into memory. Then, primary keys are built in bulk,
    taking advantage of the fact that the data is already sorted by primary key
    within each space.

    If the recovery process is non-default (``force_recovery`` is ``true``),
    Tarantool performs additional checking. Indexes are enabled at
    the start, and tuples are added one by one. This means that any unique-key
    constraint violations will be caught, and any duplicates will be skipped.
    Normally there will be no constraint violations or duplicates, so these checks
    are only made if an error has occurred.

Step 3
    Find the WAL file that was made at the time of, or after, the snapshot file.
    Read its log entries until the log-entry LSN is greater than the LSN of the
    snapshot, or greater than the LSN of the vinyl checkpoint. This is the
    recovery process's "start position"; it matches the current state of the
    engines.

Step 4
    Redo the log entries, from the start position to the end of the WAL. The
    engine skips a redo instruction if it is older than the engine's checkpoint.

Step 5
    For the memtx engine, re-create all secondary indexes.

.. _internals-replication:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Server startup with replication
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the recovery process described above, the server must take
additional steps and precautions if :ref:`replication <replication>` is enabled.

Once again the startup procedure is initiated by the ``box.cfg{}`` request.
One of the ``box.cfg`` parameters may be
:ref:`replication <cfg_replication-replication>` that specifies replication
source(-s). We will refer to this replica, which is starting up due to ``box.cfg``,
as the "local" replica to distinguish it from the other replicas in a replica set,
which we will refer to as "distant" replicas.

*If there is no snapshot .snap file and the ``replication`` parameter is empty*: |br|
then the local replica assumes it is an unreplicated "standalone" instance, or is
the first replica of a new replica set. It will generate new UUIDs for
itself and for the replica set. The replica UUID is stored in the ``_cluster`` space; the
replica set UUID is stored in the ``_schema`` space. Since a snapshot contains all the
data in all the spaces, that means the local replica's snapshot will contain the
replica UUID and the replica set UUID. Therefore, when the local replica restarts on
later occasions, it will be able to recover these UUIDs when it reads the .snap
file.

*If there is no snapshot .snap file and the ``replication`` parameter is not empty
and the ``_cluster`` space contains no other replica UUIDs*: |br|
then the local replica assumes it is not a standalone instance, but is not yet part
of a replica set. It must now join the replica set. It will send its replica UUID to the
first distant replica which is listed in ``replication`` and which will act as a
master. This is called the "join request". When a distant replica receives a join
request, it will send back:

(1) the distant replica's replica set UUID,
(2) the contents of the distant replica's .snap file. |br|
    When the local replica receives this information, it puts the replica set UUID in
    its ``_schema`` space, puts the distant replica's UUID and connection information
    in its ``_cluster`` space, and makes a snapshot containing all the data sent by
    the distant replica. Then, if the local replica has data in its WAL .xlog
    files, it sends that data to the distant replica. The distant replica will
    receive this and update its own copy of the data, and add the local replica's
    UUID to its ``_cluster`` space.

*If there is no snapshot .snap file and the ``replication`` parameter is not empty
and the ``_cluster`` space contains other replica UUIDs*: |br|
then the local replica assumes it is not a standalone instance, and is already part
of a replica set. It will send its replica UUID and replica set UUID to all the distant
replicas which are listed in ``replication``. This is called the "on-connect
handshake". When a distant replica receives an on-connect handshake: |br|

(1) the distant replica compares its own copy of the replica set UUID to the one in
    the on-connect handshake. If there is no match, then the handshake fails and
    the local replica will display an error.
(2) the distant replica looks for a record of the connecting instance in its
    ``_cluster`` space. If there is none, then the handshake fails. |br|
    Otherwise the handshake is successful. The distant replica will read any new
    information from its own .snap and .xlog files, and send the new requests to
    the local replica.

In the end ... the local replica knows what replica set it belongs to, the distant
replica knows that the local replica is a member of the replica set, and both replicas
have the same database contents.

.. _internals-vector:

*If there is a snapshot file and replication source is not empty*: |br|
first the local replica goes through the recovery process described in the
previous section, using its own .snap and .xlog files. Then it sends a
"subscribe" request to all the other replicas of the replica set. The subscribe
request contains the server vector clock. The vector clock has a collection of
pairs 'server id, lsn' for every replica in the ``_cluster`` system space. Each
distant replica, upon receiving a subscribe request, will read its .xlog files'
requests and send them to the local replica if (lsn of .xlog file request) is
greater than (lsn of the vector clock in the subscribe request). After all the
other replicas of the replica set have responded to the local replica's subscribe
request, the replica startup is complete.

The following temporary limitations apply for version 1.7:

* The URIs in the ``replication`` parameter should all be in the same order on all replicas.
  This is not mandatory but is an aid to consistency.
* The replicas of a replica set should be started up at slightly different times.
  This is not mandatory but prevents a situation where each replica is waiting
  for the other replica to be ready.
* The maximum number of entries in the ``_cluster`` space is 32. Tuples for
  out-of-date replicas are not automatically re-used, so if this 32-replica
  limit is reached, users may have to reorganize the ``_cluster`` space manually.
