The checkpoint daemon is a fiber which is constantly running. At intervals, it may
make new :ref:`snapshot (.snap) files <index-box_persistence>` and then may delete old snapshot files. If the
checkpoint daemon deletes an old snapshot file, then it will also delete any
:ref:`write-ahead log (.xlog) <internals-wal>` files which are older than the snapshot file and which contain
information that is present in the snapshot file.
It will also delete obsolete vinyl .run files.

Exceptions: the checkpoint daemon will not delete a file
if a backup is ongoing and the file has not been backed up
(see :ref:`"Hot backup" <admin-backups-hot_backup_vinyl_memtx>`),
or if replication is ongoing and the file has not been relayed to a replica
(see :ref:`"Replication architecture" <replication-architecture>`),
or if a replica is connecting.

The :ref:`checkpoint_interval <cfg_checkpoint_daemon-checkpoint_interval>` and
:ref:`checkpoint_count <cfg_checkpoint_daemon-checkpoint_count>` configuration
settings determine how long the intervals are, and how many snapshots should
exist before deletions occur.

.. _cfg_checkpoint_daemon-checkpoint_interval:

.. confval:: checkpoint_interval

    The interval between actions by the checkpoint daemon, in seconds. If
    ``checkpoint_interval`` is set to a value greater than zero, and there is
    activity which causes change to a database, then the checkpoint daemon will
    call :ref:`box.snapshot <box-snapshot>` every ``checkpoint_interval``
    seconds, creating a new snapshot file each time. If ``checkpoint_interval``
    is set to zero, then the checkpoint daemon is disabled.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: lua

        box.cfg{checkpoint_interval=60}

    will cause the checkpoint daemon to create a new database snapshot once
    per minute, if there is activity.

    | Type: integer
    | Default: 3600 (one hour)
    | Dynamic: yes

.. _cfg_checkpoint_daemon-checkpoint_count:

.. confval:: checkpoint_count

    The maximum number of snapshots that may exist on the  :ref:`memtx_dir <cfg_basic-memtx_dir>` directory
    before the checkpoint daemon will delete old snapshots. If ``checkpoint_count``
    equals zero, then the checkpoint daemon does not delete old snapshots.
    For example:

    .. code-block:: lua

        box.cfg{
            checkpoint_interval = 3600,
            checkpoint_count  = 10
        }

    will cause the checkpoint daemon to create a new snapshot each hour until
    it has created ten snapshots. After that, it will delete the oldest snapshot
    (and any associated write-ahead-log files) after creating a new one.

    | Type: integer
    | Default: 2
    | Dynamic: yes
