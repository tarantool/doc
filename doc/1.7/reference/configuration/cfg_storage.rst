.. _cfg_storage-memtx_memory:

.. confval:: memtx_memory

    How much memory Tarantool allocates to actually store tuples, in bytes.
    When the limit is reached, :ref:`INSERT <box_space-insert>` or
    :ref:`UPDATE <box_space-insert>` requests begin failing with
    error :errcode:`ER_MEMORY_ISSUE`. The server does not go beyond the
    ``memtx_memory`` limit to allocate tuples, but there is additional memory
    used to store indexes and connection information. Depending on actual
    configuration and workload, Tarantool can consume up to 20% more than the
    ``memtx_memory`` limit.

    | Type: float

.. _cfg_storage-memtx_max_tuple_size:

.. confval:: memtx_max_tuple_size

    Size of the largest allocation unit, in bytes,
    for the memtx storage engine. It can be increased if it
    is necessary to store large tuples.
    See also: :ref:`vinyl_max_tuple_size <cfg_storage-vinyl_max_tuple_size>`.

    | Type: integer
    | Default: 1024 * 1024 = 1048576
    | Dynamic: no

.. _cfg_storage-memtx_min_tuple_size:

.. confval:: memtx_min_tuple_size

    Size of the smallest allocation unit, in bytes. It can be decreased if most
    of the tuples are very small. The value must be between 8 and 1048280
    inclusive.

    | Type: integer
    | Default: 16

    Bloom filter false positive rate -- the suitable probability of the
    `bloom filter <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter>`_
    to give a wrong result.
    The ``vinyl_bloom_fpr`` setting can be overridden by a
    :ref:`create_index <box_space-create_index>` option.

.. _cfg_storage-vinyl_page_size:

.. confval:: vinyl_page_size

    Page size, in bytes. Page is a read/write unit for vinyl disk operations.

.. _cfg_storage-vinyl_run_count_per_level:

.. confval:: vinyl_run_count_per_level

    The maximal number of runs per level in vinyl LSM tree.
