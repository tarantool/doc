`libslave` tutorial
================================================================================

``libslave`` is a C++ library for reading data changes done by MysQL and,
optionally, writing them to a Tarantool database.
It works by acting as a replication slave.
The MySQL server writes data-change information to
a "binary log", and transfers the information to
any client that says "I want to see the information
starting with this file and this record, continuously".
So, ``libslave`` is primarily good for making a Tarantool database replica
(much faster than using a conventional MySQL slave server),
and for keeping track of data changes so they can be searched.

We will not go into the many details here -- the
`API documentation <https://github.com/vozbu/libslave/wiki/API>`_ has them.
We will only show an exercise: a minimal program that uses the library.

.. NOTE::

   Use a test machine. Do not use a production machine.

STEP 1: Make sure you have:

* a recent version of Linux (versions such as Ubuntu 14.04 will not do),
* a recent version of MySQL 5.6 or MySQL 5.7 server (MariaDB will not do),
* MySQL client development package. For example, on Ubuntu you can download
  it with this command:

  .. code-block:: console

     sudo apt-get install mysql-client-core-5.7

STEP 2: Download ``libslave``.

The recommended source is https://github.com/tarantool/libslave/.
Downloads include the source code only.

.. code-block:: console

    sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/tarantool/libslave.git tarantool-libslave
    cd tarantool-libslave
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    cmake .
    make

If you see an error message mentioning the word "vector",
edit ``field.h`` and add this line:

.. code-block:: c

   #include <vector>

STEP 3: Start the MySQL server. On the command line, add
appropriate switches for doing replication. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   mysqld --log-bin=mysql-bin --server-id=1

STEP 4: For purposes of this exercise, we are assuming you have:

* a "root" user with password "root" with privileges,
* a "test" database with a table named "test",
* a binary log named "mysql-bin",
* a server with server id = 1.

The values are hard-coded in the program, though of course
you can change the program -- it's easy to see their settings.

STEP 5: Look at the program:

.. code-block:: c

    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <iostream>
    #include <sstream>
    #include "Slave.h"
    #include "DefaultExtState.h"

    slave::Slave* sl = NULL;

    void callback(const slave::RecordSet& event) {
        slave::Slave::binlog_pos_t sBinlogPos = sl->getLastBinlog();
        switch (event.type_event) {
        case slave::RecordSet::Update: std::cout << "UPDATE" << "\n"; break;
        case slave::RecordSet::Delete: std::cout << "DELETE" << "\n"; break;
        case slave::RecordSet::Write:  std::cout << "INSERT" << "\n"; break;
        default: break;
        }
    }

    bool isStopping()
    {
        return 0;
    }

    int main(int argc, char** argv)
    {
        slave::MasterInfo masterinfo;
        masterinfo.conn_options.mysql_host = "127.0.0.1";
        masterinfo.conn_options.mysql_port = 3306;
        masterinfo.conn_options.mysql_user = "root";
        masterinfo.conn_options.mysql_pass = "root";
        bool error = false;
        try {
            slave::DefaultExtState sDefExtState;
            slave::Slave slave(masterinfo, sDefExtState);
            sl = &slave;
            sDefExtState.setMasterLogNamePos("mysql-bin", 0);
            slave.setCallback("test", "test", callback);
            slave.init();
            slave.createDatabaseStructure();
            try {
                slave.get_remote_binlog(isStopping);
            } catch (std::exception& ex) {
                std::cout << "Error reading: " << ex.what() << std::endl;
                error = true;
            }
        } catch (std::exception& ex) {
            std::cout << "Error initializing: " << ex.what() << std::endl;
            error = true;
        }
        return 0;
    }

Everything unnecessary has been stripped so that you can
see quickly how it works. At the start of ``main()``, there are
some settings used for connecting -- host, port, user, password.
Then there is an initialization call with the binary log file
name = "mysql-bin". Pay particular attention to the ``setCallback``
statement, which passes database name = "test", table name = "test",
and callback function address = callback. The program will be
looping and invoking this callback function. See how, earlier
in the program, the callback function prints "UPDATE" or "DELETE"
or "INSERT" depending on what is passed to it.

STEP 5: Put the program in the ``tarantool-libslave`` directory and
name it ``example.cpp``.

Step 6: Compile and build:

.. code-block:: console

   g++ -I/tarantool-libslave/include example.cpp -o example libslave_a.a -ldl -lpthread

.. NOTE::

   Replace ``tarantool-libslave/include`` with the full directory name.

   Notice that the name of the static library is ``libslave_a.a``,
   not ``libslave.a``.

Step 7: Run:

.. code-block:: console

   ./example

The result will be nothing -- the program is looping, waiting for
the MySQL server to write to the replication binary log.

Step 8: Start a MySQL client program -- any client program will do.
Enter these statements:

.. code-block:: none

    USE test
    INSERT INTO test VALUES ('A');
    INSERT INTO test VALUES ('B');
    DELETE FROM test;

Watch what happens in ``example.cpp`` output -- it displays:

.. code-block:: none

  INSERT
  INSERT
  DELETE
  DELETE

This is row-based replication, so you see two DELETEs, because there are two
rows.

What the exercise has shown is:

* the library can be built, and
* programs that use the library can access everything that
  the MySQL server dumps.
