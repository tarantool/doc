Versions later that 1.6 have incompatible :ref:`.snap <internals-snapshot>` and
:ref:`.xlog <internals-wal>` file formats: 1.6 files are
supported during upgrade, but you wonâ€™t be able to return to 1.6 after running
under 1.10 or 2.x for a while. A few configuration parameters are also renamed.

To perform a **live** upgrade from Tarantool 1.6 to a more recent version,
like :doc:`2.8.4 </release/2.8.4>`, :doc:`2.10.1 </release/2.10.1>` and such,
it is necessary to take an intermediate step by upgrading 1.6 -> **1.10** -> 2.x.
This is the only way to perform the upgrade **without downtime**.

However, a direct upgrade of a replica set from 1.6 to 2.x is also possible, but only
**with downtime**.
