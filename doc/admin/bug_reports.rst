Bug reports
================================================================================

If you found a bug in Tarantool, you’re doing us a favor by taking the time to
tell us about it.

Please create an issue at Tarantool repository at GitHub. We encourage you to
include the following information:

* Steps needed to reproduce the bug, and an explanation why this differs from
  the expected behavior according to our manual. Please provide specific unique
  information. For example, instead of "I can’t get certain information", say
  "box.space.x:delete() didn’t report what was deleted".

* Your operating system name and version, the Tarantool name and version, and
  any unusual details about your machine and its configuration.
  
* Related files like a :ref:`stack trace <admin-stack_traces>` or a Tarantool
  :ref:`log file <admin-logs>`.

If this is a feature request or if it affects a special category of users, be
sure to mention that.

Usually within one or two workdays a Tarantool team member will write an
acknowledgment, or some questions, or suggestions for a workaround.
