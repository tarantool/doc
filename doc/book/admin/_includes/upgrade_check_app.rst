Checking your application
-------------------------

Before upgrading, make sure your application works with the target Tarantool version
in a development environment:

#.  Install the target Tarantool version in a development environment. See the
    installation instructions at Tarantool
    `download page <http://tarantool.org/download.html>`_.

#.  Deploy the application on the target version. In case of any issues, fix the
    application code to ensure compatibility with the target version.

When your application is ready to run on the target Tarantool version, you can
start upgrading the production environment.
