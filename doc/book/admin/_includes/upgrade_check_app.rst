Before upgrading, make sure your application is compatible with the the target
Tarantool version:

#.  Set up a development environment with the target Tarantool version installed.
    See the installation instructions at Tarantool `download page <http://tarantool.org/download.html>`_
    and in the :ref:`tt install reference <tt-install>`.

#.  Deploy the application in this environment and check how it works. In case of
    any issues, adjust the application code to ensure compatibility with the target version.

When your application is ready to run on the target Tarantool version, you can
start upgrading the production environment.
