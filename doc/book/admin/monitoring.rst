Monitoring
==========

Monitoring is the process of capturing runtime information about the instances of a Tarantool cluster using metrics.
Metrics can indicate various characteristics, such as memory usage, the number of records in spaces, replication status, and so on.
Typically, metrics are monitored in real time, allowing for the identification of current issues or the prediction of potential ones.
