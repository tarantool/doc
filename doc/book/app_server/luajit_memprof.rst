LuaJIT memory profiler
======================

Starting from version :doc:`2.7.1 </release/2.7.1>`, Tarantool
has a built‑in module called ``misc.memprof`` that implements a LuaJIT memory
profiler (which we will just call *the profiler* in this section). The profiler provides
a memory allocation report that helps analyze Lua code and find the places
that put the most pressure on the Lua garbage collector (GC).

.. _profiler_usage:

Working with the profiler
-------------------------

Usage of the profiler involves two steps:

1.  :ref:`Collecting <profiler_usage_get>` a binary profile of allocations,
    reallocations, and deallocations in memory related to Lua
    (further, *binary memory profile* or *binary profile* for short).
2.  :ref:`Parsing <profiler_usage_parse>` the collected binary profile to get
    a human-readable profiling report.

.. _profiler_usage_get:

Collecting binary profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To collect a binary profile for a particular part of the Lua code,
you need to place this part between two ``misc.memprof`` functions,
namely, ``misc.memprof.start()`` and ``misc.memprof.stop()``, and then execute
the code under Tarantool.

Below is a chunk of simple Lua code named ``test.lua`` to illustrate this.

.. _profiler_usage_example01:

..  code-block:: lua
    :linenos:

    -- Prevent allocations on traces.
    jit.off()
    local str, err = misc.memprof.start("memprof_new.bin")
    -- Lua doesn't create a new frame to call string.rep, and all allocations
    -- are attributed not to the append() function but to the parent scope.
    local function append(str, rep)
        return string.rep(str, rep)
    end

    local t = {}
    for i = 1, 1e4 do
        -- table.insert is the built-in function and all corresponding
        -- allocations are reported in the scope of the main chunk.
        table.insert(t,
            append('q', i)
        )
    end
    local stp, err = misc.memprof.stop()

The Lua code for starting the profiler -- as in line 3 in the test.lua example above -- is:

..  code-block:: lua

    local str, err = misc.memprof.start(FILENAME)

where ``FILENAME`` is the name of the binary file where profiling events are written.

If the operation fails,
for example if it is not possible to open a file for writing or if the profiler is already running,
``misc.memprof.start()`` returns ``nil`` as the first result,
an error-message string as the second result,
and a system-dependent error code number as the third result.
If the operation succeeds, ``misc.memprof.start()`` returns ``true``.

The Lua code for stopping the profiler -- as in line 18 in the test.lua example above -- is:

..  code-block:: lua

    local stp, err = misc.memprof.stop()

If the operation fails,
for example if  there is an error when the file descriptor is being closed
or if there is a failure during reporting,
``misc.memprof.stop()`` returns ``nil`` as the first result,
an error-message string as the second result,
and a system-dependent error code number as the third result.
If the operation succeeds, ``misc.memprof.start()`` returns ``true``.

.. _profiler_usage_generate:

To generate the file with memory profile in binary format
(in the :ref:`test.lua code example above <profiler_usage_example01>`
the file name is ``memprof_new.bin``), execute the code under Tarantool:

..  code-block:: console

    $ tarantool test.lua

Tarantool collects the allocation events in ``memprof_new.bin``, puts
the file in its :ref:`working directory <cfg_basic-work_dir>`, and closes
the session.

The :ref:`test.lua code example <profiler_usage_example01>` above also illustrates the memory
allocation logic in some cases that are important to understand for
:ref:`reading <profiler_usage_parse>` and :ref:`analyzing <profiler_analysis>`
a profiling report:

*   Line 2: It is recommended to switch the JIT compilation off by calling ``jit.off()``
    before the profiler start. Refer to the following
    :ref:`note about jitoff <profiler_usage_internal_jitoff>` for more details.

*   Lines 6-8: Tail call optimization doesn't create a new call frame, so all
    allocations inside the function called via the ``CALLT/CALLMT`` `bytecodes <http://wiki.luajit.org/Bytecode-2.0#calls-and-vararg-handling>`_
    are attributed to the function's caller. See also the comments preceding these lines.

*   Lines 14-16: Usually the information about allocations inside Lua built‑ins
    is not really
    useful for developers. That's why if a Lua built‑in function is called from
    a Lua function, the profiler attributes all allocations to the Lua function.
    Otherwise, this event is attributed to a C function.
    See also the comments preceding these lines.

.. _profiler_usage_parse:

Parsing binary profile and generating profiling report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _profiler_usage_parse_command:

After getting the memory profile in binary format, the next step is
to parse it to get a human-readable profiling report. You can do this
via Tarantool by using the following command
(mind the hyphen ``-`` prior to the file name):

..  code-block:: console

    $ tarantool -e 'require("memprof")(arg)' - memprof_new.bin

where ``memprof_new.bin`` is the binary profile
:ref:`generated by 'tarantool test.lua' earlier <profiler_usage_generate>`.
(Warning: there is a slight behavior change here, the ``tarantool -e ...``
command was slightly different in Tarantool versions prior to Tarantool 2.8.1.)

Tarantool generates a profiling report and displays it on the console before closing
the session:

..  code-block:: console

    ALLOCATIONS
    @test.lua:14: 10000 events  +50240518 bytes -0 bytes
    @test.lua:9: 1 events       +32 bytes       -0 bytes

    @test.lua:9 holds 32 bytes: 1 allocs, 0 frees
    @test.lua:8 holds 20 bytes: 1 allocs, 0 frees

..  note::

    On MacOS, a report will be different for the same chunk of code because
    Tarantool and LuaJIT are built with the GC64 mode enabled for MacOS.


Let's examine the report structure. A report has four sections:

* ALLOCATIONS
* REALLOCATIONS
* DEALLOCATIONS
* HEAP SUMMARY (described later in :ref:`The heap summary and the --leak-only option<luajit_memprof_leak_only>`)

Each section contains event records that are sorted from the most frequent
to the least frequent.

An event record has the following format:

..  code-block:: text

    @<filename>:<function_line>, line <line_number>: <number_of_events> events +<allocated> bytes -<freed> bytes
    
        @test.lua:14: 10000 events  +50240518 bytes  -0 bytes

*   <filename>—a name of the file containing Lua code.
*   <function_line>—the line number where the function generating the event
    is declared. In some cases, allocations are attributed not to
    the declared function but to the main chunk -- in that case, the <function_line>
    is set to ``0``. See the :ref:`tarantool test.lua chunk above<profiler_usage_example01>`
    with the explanation in the comments for some examples.
*   <line_number>—the line number where the event is detected.
*   <number_of_events>—a number of events for this code line.
*   +<allocated> bytes—amount of memory allocated during all the events on this line.
*   -<freed> bytes—amount of memory freed during all the events on this line.

The ``Overrides`` label shows what allocation has been overridden.

.. _profiler_usage_internal_jitoff:

The ``INTERNAL`` label indicates that this event is caused by internal LuaJIT
structures.

..  note::

    Important note regarding the ``INTERNAL`` label and the recommendation
    of switching the JIT compilation off (``jit.off()``): this version of the
    profiler doesn't support verbose reporting for allocations on
    `traces <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_just-in-time_compilation#Technical_details>`_.
    If memory allocations are made on a trace,
    the profiler can't associate the allocations with the part of Lua code
    that generated the trace. In this case, the profiler labels such allocations
    as ``INTERNAL``.

    So, if the JIT compilation is on,
    new traces will be generated and there will be a mixture of events labeled
    ``INTERNAL`` in the profiling report: some of them are really caused by
    internal LuaJIT structures, but some of them are caused by allocations on
    traces.

    If you want to have a more definite report without JIT compiler allocations,
    :ref:`call jit.off() <profiler_usage_example01>` before starting the profiling.
    And if you want to completely exclude the trace allocations from the report,
    remove also the old traces by additionally calling ``jit.flush()`` after
    ``jit.off()``.

    Nevertheless, switching the JIT compilation off before the profiling is not
    "a must". It is rather a recommendation, and in some cases,
    for example in a production environment, you may need to keep JIT compilation
    on to see the full picture of all the memory allocations.
    In this case, the majority of the ``INTERNAL`` events
    are most probably caused by traces.

As for investigating the Lua code with the help of profiling reports,
it is always code-dependent and there can't be hundred per cent definite
recommendations in this regard. Nevertheless, you can see some of the things
in the :ref:`Profiling report analysis example <profiler_analysis>` later.

Also, below is the :ref:`FAQ <profiler_faq>` section with the questions that
most probably can arise while using profiler.

.. _profiler_faq:

FAQ
---

In this section, some profiler-related points are discussed in
a Q&A format.

**Question (Q)**: Is the profiler suitable for C allocations or allocations
inside C code?

**Answer (A)**: The profiler reports only allocation events caused by the Lua
allocator. All Lua-related allocations, like table or string creation
are reported. But the profiler doesn't report allocations made by ``malloc()``
or other non-Lua allocators. You can use ``valgrind`` to debug them.

|

**Q**: Why are there so many ``INTERNAL`` allocations in my profiling report?
What does it mean?

**A**: ``INTERNAL`` means that these allocations/reallocations/deallocations are
related to the internal LuaJIT structures or are made on traces.
Currently, the profiler doesn't verbosely report allocations of objects
that are made during trace execution. Try :ref:`adding jit.off() <profiler_usage_internal_jitoff>`
before the profiler start.

|

**Q**: Why are there some reallocations/deallocations without an ``Overrides``
section?

**A**: These objects can be created before the profiler starts. Adding
``collectgarbage()`` before the profiler's start enables collecting all
previously allocated objects that are dead when the profiler starts.

|

**Q**: Why are some objects not collected during profiling? Is it
a memory leak?

**A**: LuaJIT uses incremental Garbage Collector (GC). A GC cycle may not be
finished at the moment the profiler stops. Add ``collectgarbage()`` before
stopping the profiler to collect all the dead objects for sure.

|

**Q**: Can I profile not just a current chunk but the entire running application?
Can I start the profiler when the application is already running?

**A**: Yes. Here is an example of code that can be inserted in the Tarantool
console for a running instance.

..  code-block:: lua
    :linenos:

    local fiber = require "fiber"
    local log = require "log"

    fiber.create(function()
      fiber.name("memprof")

      collectgarbage() -- Collect all objects already dead
      log.warn("start of profile")

      local st, err = misc.memprof.start(FILENAME)
      if not st then
        log.error("failed to start profiler: %s", err)
      end

      fiber.sleep(TIME)

      collectgarbage()
      st, err = misc.memprof.stop()

      if not st then
        log.error("profiler on stop error: %s", err)
      end

      log.warn("end of profile")
    end)

where

*   ``FILENAME``—the name of the binary file where profiling events are written
*   ``TIME``—duration of profiling, in seconds.

Also, you can directly call ``misc.memprof.start()`` and ``misc.memprof.stop()``
from a console.

.. _profiler_analysis:

Profiling report analysis example
---------------------------------

In the example below, the following Lua code named ``format_concat.lua`` is
investigated with the help of the memory profiler reports.

.. _profiler_usage_example03:

..  code-block:: lua
    :linenos:

    -- Prevent allocations on new traces.
    jit.off()

    local function concat(a)
      local nstr = a.."a"
      return nstr
    end

    local function format(a)
      local nstr = string.format("%sa", a)
      return nstr
    end

    collectgarbage()

    local binfile = "/tmp/memprof_"..(arg[0]):match("([^/]*).lua")..".bin"

    local st, err = misc.memprof.start(binfile)
    assert(st, err)

    -- Payload.
    for i = 1, 10000 do
      local f = format(i)
      local c = concat(i)
    end
    collectgarbage()

    local st, err = misc.memprof.stop()
    assert(st, err)

    os.exit()

When you run this code :ref:`under Tarantool <profiler_usage_generate>` and
then :ref:`parse <profiler_usage_parse_command>` the binary memory profile
in /tmp/memprof_format_concat.bin,
you will get the following profiling report:

..  code-block:: console

    ALLOCATIONS
    @format_concat.lua:10: 19996 events +624284 bytes   -0 bytes
    INTERNAL: 1 events                  +65536 bytes    -0 bytes
    
    REALLOCATIONS
    
    DEALLOCATIONS
    INTERNAL: 19996 events              +0 bytes        -558778 bytes
        Overrides:
            @format_concat.lua:10
    
    @format_concat.lua:10: 2 events     +0 bytes        -98304 bytes
        Overrides:
            @format_concat.lua:10
    
    HEAP SUMMARY:
    INTERNAL holds 65536 bytes: 1 allocs, 0 frees

Reasonable questions regarding the report can be:

*   Why are there no allocations related to the ``concat()`` function?
*   Why is the number of allocations not a round number?
*   Why are there approximately 20K allocations instead of 10K?

First of all, LuaJIT doesn't create a new string if the string with the same
payload exists (see details on `lua-users.org/wiki <http://lua-users.org/wiki/ImmutableObjects>`_).
This is called `string interning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning>`_.
So, when a string is
created via the ``format()`` function, there is no need to create the same
string via the ``concat()`` function, and LuaJIT just uses the previous one.

That is also the reason why the number of allocations is not a round number
as could be expected from the cycle operator ``for i = 1, 10000...``:
Tarantool creates some
strings for internal needs and built‑in modules, so some strings already exist.

But why are there so many allocations? It's almost twice as big as the expected
amount. This is because the ``string.format()`` built‑in function creates
another string necessary for the ``%s`` identifier, so there are two allocations
for each iteration: for ``tostring(i)`` and for ``string.format("%sa", string_i_value)``.
You can see the difference in behavior by adding the line
``local _ = tostring(i)`` between lines 22 and 23.

To profile only the ``concat()`` function, comment out line 23 (which is
``local f = format(i)``) and run the profiler. Now the output will look like this:

..  code-block:: console

    ALLOCATIONS
    @format_concat.lua:5: 10000 events  +284411 bytes    -0 bytes
    
    REALLOCATIONS

    @format_concat.lua:5: 1 events      +0 bytes         -32768 bytes
    
    HEAP SUMMARY:
    @format_concat.lua:5 holds 65536 bytes: 10000 allocs, 9999 frees

**Q**: But what will change if JIT compilation is enabled?

**A**: In the :ref:`code <profiler_usage_example03>`, comment out line 2 (which is
``jit.off()``) and run
the profiler . Now there are only 56 allocations in the report, and all other
allocations are JIT-related (see also the related
`dev issue <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/5679>`_):

..  code-block:: console

    ALLOCATIONS
    @format_concat.lua:5: 56 events +1112 bytes -0 bytes
    @format_concat.lua:0: 4 events  +640 bytes  -0 bytes
    INTERNAL: 2 events              +382 bytes  -0 bytes
    
    REALLOCATIONS
    
    DEALLOCATIONS
    INTERNAL: 58 events             +0 bytes    -1164 bytes
        Overrides:
            @format_concat.lua:5
            INTERNAL
    
    
    HEAP SUMMARY:
    @format_concat.lua:0 holds 640 bytes: 4 allocs, 0 frees
    INTERNAL holds 360 bytes: 2 allocs, 1 frees



This happens because a trace has been compiled after 56 iterations (the default
value of the ``hotloop`` compiler parameter). Then, the
JIT-compiler removed the unused variable ``c`` from the trace, and, therefore,
the dead code of the ``concat()`` function is eliminated.

Next, let's profile only the ``format()`` function with JIT enabled.
For that, comment out lines 2 and 24 (``jit.off()`` and
``local c = concat(i)``), do not comment out line 23
(``local f = format(i)``), and run the profiler.
Now the output will look like this:

..  code-block:: console

    ALLOCATIONS
    @format_concat.lua:10: 19996 events +624284 bytes  -0 bytes
    INTERNAL: 4 events                  +66928 bytes   -0 bytes

        Overrides:
            @format_concat.lua:10
    
    
    HEAP SUMMARY:
    INTERNAL holds 66928 bytes: 4 allocs, 0 frees
    @format_concat.lua:0 holds 384 bytes: 4 allocs, 1 frees

**Q**: Why are there so many allocations in comparison to the ``concat()`` function?

**A**: The answer is simple: the ``string.format()`` function with the ``%s``
identifier is not yet compiled via LuaJIT. So, a trace can't be recorded and
the compiler doesn't perform the corresponding optimizations.

If we change the ``format()`` function in lines 9-12 of the
:ref:`Profiling report analysis example <profiler_usage_example03>`
in the following way

..  code-block:: lua

    local function format(a)
      local nstr = string.format("%sa", tostring(a))
      return nstr
    end

the profiling report becomes much prettier:

..  code-block:: console

    ALLOCATIONS
    @format_concat.lua:10: 109 events   +2112 bytes -0 bytes
    @format_concat.lua:0: 4 events      +640 bytes  -0 bytes

            @format_concat.lua:10
            INTERNAL
    
    
    HEAP SUMMARY:
    INTERNAL holds 1144 bytes: 3 allocs, 1 frees
    @format_concat.lua:0 holds 384 bytes: 4 allocs, 1 frees

.. _luajit_memprof_leak_only:

The heap summary and the --leak-only option
-------------------------------------------

This feature was added in version :doc:`2.8.1 </release/2.8.1>`.

The end of each display is a HEAP SUMMARY section which looks like this:

@<filename>:<line number> holds <number of still reachable bytes> bytes: <number of allocation events> allocs, <number of deallocation events> frees

Sometimes a program can cause many deallocations, so
the DEALLOCATION section can become large, so the display is not easy to read.
To minimize output, start the parsing with an extra flag: ``--leak-only``,
for example

..  code-block:: console

    $ tarantool -e 'require("memprof")(arg)' - --leak-only memprof_new.bin

When `--leak-only`` is used, only the HEAP SUMMARY section is displayed.
