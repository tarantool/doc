Monitoring a replica set
================================================================================

To learn what instances belong in the replica set, and obtain statistics for all
these instances, issue a :doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_info/replication` request:

.. code-block:: tarantoolsession

    tarantool> box.info.replication

      replication:

This report is for a master-master replica set of three instances, each having
its own instance id, UUID and log sequence number.

The request was issued at master #1, and the reply includes statistics for the
other two masters, given in regard to master #1.

The primary indicators of replication health are:

.. _heartbeat:

* :ref:`idle <box_info_replication_upstream_idle>`, the time (in seconds) since
  the instance received the last event from a master.

  A master sends heartbeat messages to a replica every second, and the master
  is programmed to disconnect if it does not see acknowledgments of the heartbeat messages
  within :ref:`replication_timeout <cfg_replication-replication_timeout>` * 4
  seconds.

  Therefore, in a healthy replication setup, ``idle`` should never exceed
  ``replication_timeout``: if it does, either the replication is lagging
  seriously behind, because the master is running ahead of the replica, or the
  network link between the instances is down.

* :ref:`lag <box_info_replication_upstream_lag>`, the time difference between
  the local time at the instance, recorded when the event was received, and the
  local time at another master recorded when the event was written to the
  :ref:`write ahead log <internals-wal>` on that master.

  Since the ``lag`` calculation uses the operating system clocks from two different
  machines, do not be surprised if itâ€™s negative: a time drift may lead to the
  remote master clock being consistently behind the local instance's clock.

  For multi-master configurations, ``lag`` is the maximal lag.
