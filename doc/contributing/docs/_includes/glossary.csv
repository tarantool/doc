tuple;кортеж;A tuple plays the same role as a “row” or a “record”. The number of tuples in a space is unlimited. Tuples in Tarantool are stored as MsgPack arrays. https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/book/box/data_model/#tuples;

primary index;первичный индекс;The first index defined on a space is called the primary key index, and it must be unique. All other indexes are called secondary indexes, and they may be non-unique. https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/book/box/data_model/#indexes;
fiber;файбер;A fiber is a set of instructions which are executed with cooperative multitasking. Fibers managed by the fiber module are associated with a user-supplied function called the fiber function. https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/reference/reference_lua/fiber/#fibers;
Tarantool garbage collector;сборщик мусора в Tarantool;A garbage collector fiber runs in the background on the master storages of each replica set. It starts deleting the contents of the bucket in the GARBAGE state part by part. Once the bucket is empty, its record is deleted from the _bucket system space. https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/reference/reference_rock/vshard/vshard_admin/#garbage-collector;
Lua garbage collector;сборщик мусора на Lua;Lua manages memory automatically by running a garbage collector from time to time to collect all dead objects (that is, objects that are no longer accessible from Lua). https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.10;
storage engine;движок базы данных;A storage engine is a set of very-low-level routines which actually store and retrieve tuple values. https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/book/box/engines/;
