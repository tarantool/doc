space;спейс;A space is a container for tuples.;
tuple;кортеж;A tuple plays the same role as a “row” or a “record”. The number of tuples in a space is unlimited. Tuples in Tarantool are stored as MsgPack arrays.;
Tarantool;Tarantool;НЕ ПЕРЕВОДИТЬ;
primary index;первичный индекс;The first index defined on a space is called the primary key index, and it must be unique. All other indexes are called secondary indexes, and they may be non-unique. https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/book/box/data_model/#indexes;
fiber;файбер;A fiber is a set of instructions which are executed with cooperative multitasking. Fibers managed by the fiber module are associated with a user-supplied function called the fiber function. https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/reference/reference_lua/fiber/#fibers;
Tarantool garbage collector;сборщик мусора в Tarantool;A garbage collector fiber runs in the background on the master storages of each replica set. It starts deleting the contents of the bucket in the GARBAGE state part by part. Once the bucket is empty, its record is deleted from the _bucket system space. https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/reference/reference_rock/vshard/vshard_admin/#garbage-collector;
Lua garbage collector;сборщик мусора на Lua;Lua manages memory automatically by running a garbage collector from time to time to collect all dead objects (that is, objects that are no longer accessible from Lua). https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.10;
storage engine;движок базы данных;A storage engine is a set of very-low-level routines which actually store and retrieve tuple values. https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/book/box/engines/;
thread;поток;A thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system.;

Release policy;Релизная политика;A set of rules for releasing and naming new distributions of Tarantool: where we add new features and where we don't, how we give them numbers, what versions are suitable to use in production.;
field;поле;Fields are distinct data values, contained in a tuple. They play the same role as «row columns» or «record fields» in relational databases.;

clause;предложение, блок;(SQL) A clause in SQL is a part of a query that lets you filter or customizes how you want your data to be queried to you.;
expression;выражение;;
predicate;предикат;(SQL) Predicates, which specify conditions that can be evaluated to SQL three-valued logic (3VL) (true/false/unknown) or Boolean truth values and are used to limit the effects of statements and queries, or to change program flow.;
query;запрос;(SQL) Queries retrieve the data based on specific criteria. A query is a statement that returns a result set (possibly empty).;
result set;результат запроса;(SQL) An SQL result set is a set of rows from a database, as well as metadata about the query such as the column names, and the types and sizes of each column. A result set is effectively a table.;
statement;инструкция;(SQL) A statement is any text that the database engine recognizes as a valid command.;(SQL) Любой текст, который распознаётся движком БД как команда. Инструкция состоит из ключевых слов и выражений языка SQL, которые предписывают Tarantool выполнять какие-либо действия с базой данных.
