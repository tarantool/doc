How to write release notes
==========================

Release notes are generated by a script from individual changelog strings.
Below are some best practices to make these changelog strings consistent, neat, and human-oriented.

*   Use the past tense to describe changed or fixed behavior.
    Example: 'Fixed a false positive panic when yielding in debug hook (gh-5649)'.
*   Use the present tense to describe new behavior.
    Example: 'Data changes in read-only mode are now forbidden (gh-5231)'.
*   Start with a capital letter, end with a period. 

Note that these guidelines differ from commit message best practices that suggest using the imperative mood.
