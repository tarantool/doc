Versioning policy
-----------------

A Tarantool Enterprise SDK version consists of two parts:

..  code-block:: text

    <TARANTOOL_BASE_VERSION>-r<REVISION>


For example: ``2.11.1-0-gc42d9735b-r589``.

-   ``TARANTOOL_BASE_VERSION`` is the Community version which the Enterprise version is based on.
-   ``REVISION`` is the SDK revision. Besides Tarantool itself, it includes the ``tt`` utility, a set of open and closed source modules, and examples. Learn more from :ref:`Package contents <enterprise-package-contents>`.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*   Default audit log format was changed to CSV.

Functionality added or changed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enterprise
^^^^^^^^^^

*   Implemented user-defined audit events. Now it's possible to log custom
    messages to the audit log from Lua (:tarantool-ee-issue:`65`).

*   **[Breaking change]** Switched the default audit log format to CSV. The
    format can be switched back to JSON using the new ``box.cfg.audit_format``
    configuration option (:tarantool-ee-issue:`66`).

*   Implemented the audit log filter. Now, it's possible to enable logging only
    for a subset of all audit events using the new ``box.cfg.audit_filter``
    configuration option (:tarantool-ee-issue:`67`).

Core
^^^^

*   Implement constraints and foreign keys. Now a user can create function constraints and foreign key relations
    (:tarantool-issue:`6436`).
*   Changed log level of some information messages from critical to info
    (:tarantool-issue:`4675`).
*   Added predefined system events: ``box.status``, ``box.id``, ``box.election``
    and ``box.schema`` (:tarantool-issue:`6260`).
*   Introduced transaction isolation levels in Lua and IPROTO (:tarantool-issue:`6930`).

Vinyl
^^^^^

*   Disabled the deferred DELETE optimization in Vinyl to avoid possible
    performance degradation of secondary index reads. Now, to enable the
    optimization, one has to set the ``defer_deletes`` flag in space options
    (:tarantool-issue:`4501`).

Lua
^^^

*   Added support of console autocompletion for net.box objects ``stream``
    and ``future`` (:tarantool-issue:`6305`).

Datetime
^^^^^^^^

*   Parse method to allow converting string literals in extended iso-8601
     or rfc3339 formats (:tarantool-issue:`6731`).
*   The range of supported years has been extended in all parsers to cover
     fully -5879610-06-22..5879611-07-11 (:tarantool-issue:`6731`).

Build
^^^^^

*   Added bundling of *GNU libunwind* to support backtrace feature on
    *AARCH64* architecture and distributives that don't provide *libunwind*
    package.
*   Re-enabled backtrace feature for all *RHEL* distributions by default, except
    for *AARCH64* architecture and ancient *GCC* versions, which lack compiler
    features required for backtrace (gh-4611).

Bugs fixed
~~~~~~~~~~

Enterprise
^^^^^^^^^^

*   Disabled audit log unless explicitly configured (:tarantool-ee-issue:`39`). Before this change,
    audit events were written to stderr if ``box.cfg.audit_log`` wasn't set. Now,
    audit log is disabled in this case.
*   Disabled audit logging of replicated events (:tarantool-ee-issue:`59`). Now, replicated events
    (for example, user creation) are logged only on the origin, never on a
    replica.

Core
^^^^

*   Banned DDL operations in space on_replace triggers, since they could lead
    to a crash (:tarantool-issue:`6920`).
*   Fixed a bug due to which all fibers created with ``fiber_attr_setstacksize()``
    leaked until the thread exit. Their stacks also leaked except when
    ``fiber_set_joinable(..., true)`` was used.
*   Fixed a crash in mvcc connected with secondary index conflict (:tarantool-issue:`6452`).
*   Fixed a bug which resulted in wrong space count (:tarantool-issue:`6421`).
*   Select in RO transaction now reads confirmed data, like a standalone (auotcommit) select does
    (:tarantool-issue:`6452`).

Replication
^^^^^^^^^^^

*   Fixed potential obsolete data write in synchronious replication
    due to race in accessing terms while disk write operation is in
    progress and not yet completed.
*   Fixed replicas failing to bootstrap when master is just re-started (:tarantool-issue:`6966`).

Lua
^^^

*   Fixed the behavior of tarantool console on SIGINT. Now Ctrl+C discards
    the current input and prints the new prompt (:tarantool-issue:`2717`).

Triggers
^^^^^^^^

*   Fixed assertion or segfault when MP_EXT received via net.box (:tarantool-issue:`6766`).
*   Now ROUND() properly support INTEGER and DECIMAL as the first
    argument (:tarantool-issue:`6988`).

Datetime
^^^^^^^^

*   Intervals received after datetime arithmetic operations may be improperly
    normalized if result was negative

    ..  code-block:: tarantoolsession

        tarantool> date.now() - date.now()
        ---
        - -1.000026000 seconds
        ...

    I.e. 2 immediately called ``date.now()`` produce very close values, whose
    difference should be close to 0, not 1 second (gh-6882).

Net.box
^^^^^^^

*   Changed the type of the error returned by net.box on timeout
    from ClientError to TimedOut (:tarantool-issue:`6144`).

r457
----

-   Fixed some binary protocol encryption bugs.

r455
----

-   Added :ref:`binary protocol encryption <enterprise-iproto-encryption>`.
-   Added :doc:`tuple field compression <tuple_compression>`.
