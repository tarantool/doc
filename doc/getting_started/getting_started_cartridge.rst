Creating your first Tarantool Cartridge application
===================================================

Here we'll walk you through developing a simple cluster application.

First,
:doc:`set up the development environment </book/cartridge/cartridge_cli/installation>`.

Next, create an application named ``myapp``. Run:

..  code-block:: console

    $ cartridge create --name myapp

This will create a Tarantool Cartridge application in the ``./myapp`` directory,
with a handful of
:doc:`template files and directories </book/cartridge/cartridge_cli/commands/create>`
inside.

Go inside and make a dry run:

..  code-block:: console

    $ cd ./myapp
    $ cartridge build
    $ cartridge start

This will build the application locally, start 5 instances of Tarantool
and a :ref:`stateboard <cartridge-stateful_failover>` (state provider), and
run the application as it is, with no business logic yet.

Why 5 instances and a stateboard? See the ``instances.yml`` file in your application directory.
It contains the :ref:`configuration <cartridge-deployment>` of all instances
that you can use in the cluster. By default, it defines configuration for 5
Tarantool instances and a stateboard.

..  code-block:: yaml

    ---
    myapp.router:
      advertise_uri: localhost:3301
      http_port: 8081

    myapp.s1-master:
      advertise_uri: localhost:3302
      http_port: 8082

    myapp.s1-replica:
      advertise_uri: localhost:3303
      http_port: 8083

    myapp.s2-master:
      advertise_uri: localhost:3304
      http_port: 8084

    myapp.s2-replica:
      advertise_uri: localhost:3305
      http_port: 8085

    myapp-stateboard:
      listen: localhost:4401
      password: passwd

You can already see these instances in the cluster management web interface at
http://localhost:8081 (here 8081 is the HTTP port of the first instance
specified in ``instances.yml``).

Okay, press ``Ctrl + C`` to stop the cluster for a while.

Now itâ€™s time to add some business logic to your application.
This will be an evergreen "Hello world!"" -- just to keep things simple.

Rename the template file ``app/roles/custom.lua`` to ``hello-world.lua``.

..  code-block:: console

    $ mv app/roles/custom.lua app/roles/hello-world.lua

This will be your *role*. In Tarantool Cartridge, a role is a Lua module that
implements some instance-specific functions and/or logic.
Further on we'll show how to add code to a role, build it, enable and test.

There is already some code in the role's ``init()`` function.

..  code-block:: lua
    :emphasize-lines: 5-7

    local function init(opts) -- luacheck: no unused args
        -- if opts.is_master then
        -- end

        local httpd = assert(cartridge.service_get('httpd'), "Failed to get httpd service")
        httpd:route({method = 'GET', path = '/hello'}, function()
            return {body = 'Hello world!'}
        end)

        return true
    end

This exports an HTTP endpoint ``/hello``. For example, http://localhost:8081/hello
if you address the first instance from the ``instances.yml`` file.
If you open it in a browser after enabling the role (we'll do it here a bit later),
you'll see "Hello world!" on the page.

Let's add some more code there.

..  code-block:: lua
    :emphasize-lines: 9-11

    local function init(opts) -- luacheck: no unused args
        -- if opts.is_master then
        -- end

        local httpd = cartridge.service_get('httpd')
        httpd:route({method = 'GET', path = '/hello'}, function()
            return {body = 'Hello world!'}
        end)

        local log = require('log')
        log.info('Hello world!')

        return true
    end

This writes "Hello, world!" to the console when the role gets enabled,
so you'll have a chance to spot this. No rocket science.

Next, amend ``role_name`` in the "return" section of the ``hello-world.lua`` file.
You'll see this section at the bottom of the file.
This text will be displayed as a label for your role in the cluster management
web interface.

.. code-block:: lua
   :emphasize-lines: 2

    return {
        role_name = 'Hello world!',
        init = init,
        stop = stop,
        validate_config = validate_config,
        apply_config = apply_config,
        -- dependencies = {'cartridge.roles.vshard-router'},
    }

The final thing to do before you can run the application is to add your role to
the list of available cluster roles in the ``init.lua`` file in the project root directory.

..  code-block:: lua
    :emphasize-lines: 8

    local cartridge = require('cartridge')

    local ok, err = cartridge.cfg({
        roles = {
            'cartridge.roles.vshard-storage',
            'cartridge.roles.vshard-router',
            'cartridge.roles.metrics',
            'app.roles.hello-world',
        },
    })

Now the cluster will be aware of your role.

Why ``app.roles.hello-world``? By default, the role name here should match the
path from the application root (``./myapp``) to the role file
(``app/roles/hello-world.lua``).

Great! Your role is ready. Re-build the application and re-start the cluster now:

..  code-block:: console

    $ cartridge build
    $ cartridge start

Now all instances are up, but idle, waiting for you to enable roles for them.

Instances (replicas) in a Tarantool Cartridge cluster are organized into
*replica sets*. Roles are enabled per replica set, so all instances in a
replica set have the same roles enabled.

Let's create a replica set containing just one instance and enable your role:

#.  Open the cluster management web interface at http://localhost:8081.
#.  Next to the **router** instance, click :guilabel:`Configure`.
#.  Check the role ``Hello world!`` to enable it. Notice that the role name here
    matches the label text that you specified in the ``role_name`` parameter in
    the ``hello-world.lua`` file.
#.  (Optionally) Specify the replica set name, for example
    "hello-world-replica-set".

    ..  image:: images/cluster_create_replica_set-border-5px.png
        :align: center
        :scale: 40%

#.  Click :guilabel:`Create replica set` and see the newly-created replica set
    in the web interface.

    ..  image:: images/cluster_new_replica_set-border-5px.png
        :align: center
        :scale: 40%

Your custom role got enabled. Find the "Hello world!" message in console,
like this:

..  image:: images/cluster_hello_world_console-border-5px.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 40%

Finally, open the HTTP endpoint of this instance at
http://localhost:8081/hello and see the reply to your GET request.

    :scale: 40%
