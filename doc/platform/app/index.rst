Applications
============

Using Tarantool as an application server, you can write your own applications.
Tarantoolâ€™s native language for writing applications is
`Lua <http://www.lua.org/about.html>`_, so a typical application would be
a file that contains your Lua script. But you can also write applications
in C or C++.
