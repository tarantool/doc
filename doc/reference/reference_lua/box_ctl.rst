                                Submodule `box.ctl`
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ``box.ctl`` submodule contains two functions: ``wait_ro``
(wait until read-only)
and ``wait_rw`` (wait until read-write).
The functions are useful during initialization of a server.

A particular use is for :doc:`box.once() </reference/reference_lua/box_once>`.
For example, when a replica is initializing, it may call
a ``box.once()`` function while the server is still in
read-only mode, and fail to make changes that are necessary
only once before the replica is fully initialized.
This could cause conflicts between a master and a replica
if the master is in read-write mode and the replica is in
read-only mode.
Waiting until "read only mode = false" solves this problem.

To see whether a function is already in read-only or
read-write mode, check :ref:`box.info.ro <box_introspection-box_info>`.

Below is a list of all ``box.ctl`` functions.
