.. class:: index_object

    .. method:: pairs([key [,{iterator = iterator-type}]])

        Search for a tuple or a set of tuples via the given index,
        and allow iterating over one tuple at a time.

        The :samp:`{key}` parameter specifies what must match within the index.

        .. NOTE::

            :samp:`{key}` is only used to find the first match. Do not assume
            all matched tuples will contain the key.

        The :samp:`{iterator}` parameter specifies the rule for matching and
        ordering. Different index types support different iterators. For
        example, a TREE index maintains a strict order of keys and can return
        all tuples in ascending or descending order, starting from the specified
        key. Other index types, however, do not support ordering.

        To understand consistency of tuples returned by an iterator, it's
        essential to know the principles of the Tarantool transaction processing
        subsystem. An iterator in Tarantool does not own a consistent read view.
        Instead, each procedure is granted exclusive access to all tuples and
        spaces until there is a "context switch": which may happen due to
        :ref:`the implicit yield rules <atomic-implicit-yields>`, or by an
        explicit call to :ref:`fiber.yield <fiber-yield>`. When the execution
        flow returns to the yielded procedure, the data set could have changed
        significantly. Iteration, resumed after a yield point, does not preserve
        the read view, but continues with the new content of the database. The
        tutorial :ref:`Indexed pattern search
        <c_lua_tutorial-indexed_pattern_search>` shows one way that iterators
        and yields can be used together.

        For information about iterators' internal structures see the
        `"Lua Functional library" <https://luafun.github.io/index.html>`_
        documentation.

        :param index_object index_object: an :ref:`object reference
                                          <app_server-object_reference>`.
        :param scalar/table key: value to be matched against the index key,
                                 which may be multi-part
        :param iterator: as defined in tables below. The default iterator type
                         is 'EQ'


        :return: `iterator <https://www.lua.org/pil/7.1.html>`_ which can be
                 used in a for/end loop or with `totable()
                 <https://luafun.github.io/reducing.html#fun.totable>`_

        **Possible errors:**

        * no such space; wrong type;
        * selected iteration type is not supported for the index type;
        * key is not supported for the iteration type.

        **Complexity factors:** Index size, Index type; Number of tuples
        accessed.

        A search-key-value can be a number (for example ``1234``), a string
        (for example ``'abcd'``), or a table of numbers and strings (for example
        ``{1234, 'abcd'}``). Each part of a key will be compared to each part of
        an index key.

        The returned tuples will be in order by index key value, or by the hash of
        the index key value if index type = 'hash'. If the index is non-unique, then
        duplicates will be secondarily in order by primary key value. The order
        will be reversed if the iterator type is 'LT' or 'LE' or 'REQ'.

            Informally, we can state that searches with TREE indexes are
            generally what users will find is intuitive, provided that there
            are no nils and no missing parts. Formally, the logic is as follows.
            A search key has zero or more parts, for example {}, {1,2,3},{1,nil,3}.
            An index key has one or more parts, for example {1}, {1,2,3},{1,2,3}.
            A search key may contain nil (but not msgpack.NULL, which is the wrong type).
            An index key may not contain nil or msgpack.NULL, although a later version
            of Tarantool will have different rules --  the behavior of searches with nil is subject to change.
            Possible iterators are LT, LE, EQ, REQ, GE, GT.
            A search key is said to "match" an index key if the following
            statements, which are pseudocode for the comparison operation,
            return TRUE.

        **First example of index pairs():**

        Default 'TREE' Index and ``pairs()`` function:

        .. code-block:: tarantoolsession

            tarantool> s = box.schema.space.create('space17')
            ---
            ...
            tarantool> s:create_index('primary', {
                     >   parts = {1, 'string', 2, 'string'}
                     > })
            ---
            ...
            tarantool> s:insert{'C', 'C'}
            ---
            - ['C', 'C']
            ...
            tarantool> s:insert{'B', 'A'}
            ---
            - ['B', 'A']
            ...
            tarantool> s:insert{'C', '!'}
            ---
            - ['C', '!']
            ...
            tarantool> s:insert{'A', 'C'}
            ---
            - ['A', 'C']
            ...
            tarantool> function example()
                     >   for _, tuple in
                     >     s.index.primary:pairs(nil, {
                     >         iterator = box.index.ALL}) do
                     >       print(tuple)
                     >   end
                     > end
            ---
            ...
            tarantool> example()
            ['A', 'C']
            ['B', 'A']
            ['C', '!']
            ['C', 'C']
            ---
            ...
            tarantool> s:drop()
            ---
            ...

        **Second example of index pairs():**

        This Lua code finds all the tuples whose primary key values begin with 'XY'.
        The assumptions include that there is a one-part primary-key
        TREE index on the first field, which must be a string. The iterator loop ensures
        that the search will return tuples where the first value
        is greater than or equal to 'XY'. The conditional statement
        within the loop ensures that the looping will stop when the
        first two letters are not 'XY'.

        .. code-block:: lua

            for _, tuple in
            box.space.t.index.primary:pairs("XY",{iterator = "GE"}) do
              if (string.sub(tuple[1], 1, 2) ~= "XY") then break end
              print(tuple)
            end

        **Third example of index pairs():**

        This Lua code finds all the tuples whose primary key values are
        greater than or equal to 1000, and less than or equal to 1999
        (this type of request is sometimes called a "range search" or a "between search").
        The assumptions include that there is a one-part primary-key
        TREE index on the first field, which must be a :ref:`number <index-box_number>`. The iterator loop ensures
        that the search will return tuples where the first value
        is greater than or equal to 1000. The conditional statement
        within the loop ensures that the looping will stop when the
        first value is greater than 1999.

        .. code-block:: lua

            for _, tuple in
            box.space.t2.index.primary:pairs(1000,{iterator = "GE"}) do
              if (tuple[1] > 1999) then break end
              print(tuple)
            end
