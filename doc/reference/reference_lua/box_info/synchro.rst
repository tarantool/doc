    Since version :doc:`2.8.1 </release/2.8.1>`.

    The current state of synchronous replication.

    In :ref:`synchronous replication <repl_sync>`, transaction is considered committed only after achieving
    the required quorum number.
    While transactions are collecting confirmations from remote nodes, these transactions are waiting in the queue.

    The following information is provided:

    *   ``queue``:

        -   ``owner`` (since version :doc:`2.10.0 </release/2.10.0>`) -- ID of the replica that owns the synchronous
            transaction queue. Once an owner instance appears, all other instances become read-only.
            If the ``owner`` field is ``0``, then every instance may be writable,
            but they can't create any synchronous transactions.
            To claim or reclaim the queue, use :ref:`box.ctl.promote() <box_ctl-promote>` on the instance that you want
            to promote.
            To clear the ownership, call :ref:`box.ctl.demote() <box_ctl-demote>` on the synchronous queue owner.

            When Raft election is enabled and :ref:`replication.election_mode <configuration_reference_replication_election_mode>`
            is set to ``candidate``, the new Raft leader claims the queue automatically after winning the elections.
            It means that the value of ``box.info.synchro.queue.owner`` becomes equal to :ref:`box.info.election.leader <box_info_election>`.
            When Raft is enabled, no manual intervention with ``box.ctl.promote()`` or ``box.ctl.demote()`` is required.

        -   ``term`` (since version :doc:`2.10.0 </release/2.10.0>`) -- current queue term.
            It contains the term of the last ``PROMOTE`` request.
            Usually, it is equal to :ref:`box.info.election.term <box_info_election>`.
            However, the queue term value may be less than the election term.
            It can happen when a new round of elections has started, but no instance has been promoted yet.

        -   ``len`` -- the number of entries that are currently waiting in the queue.

        -   ``busy`` (since version :doc:`2.10.0 </release/2.10.0>`) -- the boolean value is ``true``
            when the instance is processing or writing some system request that modifies the queue
            (for example, ``PROMOTE``, ``CONFIRM``, or ``ROLLBACK``).
            Until the request is complete, any other incoming synchronous transactions and system requests
            will be delayed.

        -   ``age`` (since version :doc:`3.2.0 </release/3.2.0>`) -- the time in seconds that the oldest entry currently
            present in the queue has spent waiting for the quorum to collect.

        -   ``confirm_lag`` (since version :doc:`3.2.0 </release/3.2.0>`) -- the time in seconds that the latest successfully
            confirmed entry waited for the quorum to collect.

    *   ``quorum`` -- the resulting value of the
        :ref:`replication.synchro_quorum <configuration_reference_replication_synchro_quorum>` configuration option.
        Since version :doc:`2.5.3 </release/2.5.3>`, the option can be set as a dynamic formula.
        In this case, the value of the ``quorum`` member depends on the current number of replicas.

    **Example 1:**

    In this example, the ``quorum`` field is equal to `1`.
    That is, synchronous transactions work like asynchronous ones.
    `1` means that a successful WAL writing to the master is enough to commit.

    ..  code-block:: tarantoolsession

        box_info_synchro:instance001> box.info.synchro
        ---
        - queue:
            owner: 1
            confirm_lag: 0
            term: 2
            age: 0
            len: 0
            busy: false
          quorum: 1
        ...

    **Example 2:**

    Example on GitHub: `box_info_synchro <https://github.com/tarantool/doc/tree/latest/doc/code_snippets/snippets/replication/instances.enabled/box_info_synchro>`_

    In this example, there are two instances:

    - ``instance001`` is going to be the leader.
    - ``instance002`` is a follower instance.

    ..  literalinclude:: /code_snippets/snippets/replication/instances.enabled/box_info_synchro/config.yaml
        :language: yaml
        :start-at: groups
        :end-at: 3302
        :dedent:

    On the **first** instance, grant the user with the ``super`` role:

    ..  code-block:: tarantoolsession

        box_info_synchro:instance001> box.schema.user.grant('guest', 'super')

    After that, use the ``box.ctl.promote()`` function to claim the queue:

    ..  code-block:: tarantoolsession

        box_info_synchro:instance001> box.ctl.promote()

    Create a space named ``sync`` and enable synchronous replication on this space:

    ..  code-block:: tarantoolsession

        box_info_synchro:instance001> s = box.schema.space.create("sync", {is_sync=true})

    Then, create an index:

    ..  code-block:: tarantoolsession

        box_info_synchro:instance001> _ = s:create_index('pk')

    Check the current state of synchronous replication:

    ..  code-block:: tarantoolsession

        box_info_synchro:instance001> box.info.synchro
        ---
        - queue:
            owner: 1
            confirm_lag: 0
            term: 2
            age: 0
            len: 0
            busy: false
          quorum: 2
        ...

    On the **second** instance, simulate failure like if this instance would crash or go out of the network:

    ..  code-block:: tarantoolsession

        box_info_synchro:instance002> os.exit(0)
           тип Connection was closed. Probably instance process isn't running anymore

    On the **first** instance, try to perform some synchronous transactions.
    The transactions would hang, because the :ref:`replication.synchro_quorum <configuration_reference_replication_synchro_quorum>`
    option is set to `2`, and the second instance is not available:

    ..  code-block:: tarantoolsession

        box_info_synchro:instance001> fiber = require('fiber')
        ---
        ...
        box_info_synchro:instance001> for i = 1, 3 do fiber.new(function() box.space.sync:replace{i} end) end
        ---
        ...

    Call the ``box.info.synchro`` command on the first instance again:

    ..  code-block:: tarantoolsession

        box_info_synchro:instance001> box.info.synchro
        ---
        - queue:
            owner: 1
            confirm_lag: 0
            term: 2
            age: 5.2658250015229
            len: 3
            busy: false
          quorum: 2
        ...

    The ``len`` field is now equal to 3. It means that there are 3 transactions waiting in the queue.
