.. function:: box.prepare(sql-statement)

    Prepare the SQL statement contained in the sql-statement parameter.
    The syntax and requirements for ``box.prepare`` are the same as for
    :doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_sql/execute`.

    :param string sql-statement: statement, which should conform to
                                 :ref:`the rules for SQL grammar <sql_statements_and_clauses>`

    :return: prepared_table, with id and methods and metadata
    :rtype:  table

    ``box.prepare`` compiles an SQL statement into byte code and saves the byte
    code in a cache. Since compiling takes a significant amount of time, preparing
    a statement will enhance performance if the statement is executed many times.

    If ``box.prepare`` succeeds, prepared_table contains:

    * ``stmt_id``: integer -- an identifier generated by a hash of the statement string
    * ``execute``: function
    * ``params``: map [name : string, type : string] -- parameter descriptions
    * ``unprepare``: function
    * ``metadata``: map [name : string, type : string] (This is present only for
      SELECT or PRAGMA statements and has the same contents as the
      :ref:`result set metadata <box-sql_result_sets>` for ``box.execute``)
    * ``param_count``: integer -- number of parameters

    This can be used by :ref:`prepared_table:execute() <box-sql_box_execute_prepared_statement>`
    and by :ref:`prepared_table:unprepare() <box-sql_box_unprepare_prepared_statement>`.

    The prepared statement cache (which is also called the prepared statement holder)
    is "shared", that is, there is one cache for
    all sessions. However, session X cannot execute a statement prepared by session Y. |br|
    For monitoring the cache, see :ref:`box.info().sql <box_introspection-box_info>`. |br|
    For changing the cache, see :ref:`(Configuration reference) sql_cache_size <cfg_basic-sql_cache_size>`.

    Prepared statements will "expire" (become invalid) if
    any database object is dropped or created or altered --
    even if the object is not mentioned in the SQL statement,
    even if the create or drop or alter is rolled back,
    even if the create or drop or alter is done in a different session.
