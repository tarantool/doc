Functions for transaction management
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For general information and examples, see section
:ref:`Transaction control <atomic-atomic_execution>`.

Observe the following rules when working with transactions:

.. admonition:: Rule #1
    :class: FACT

    The requests in a transaction must be sent to a server as a single block.
    It is not enough to enclose them between begin and commit or rollback.
    To ensure they are sent as a single block: put them in a function, or put
    them all on one line, or use a delimiter so that multi-line requests
    are handled together.

.. admonition:: Rule #2
    :class: FACT

    All database operations in a transaction should use the same storage engine.
    It is not safe to access tuple sets that are defined with ``{engine='vinyl'}``
    and also access tuple sets that are defined with ``{engine='memtx'}``,
    in the same transaction.

.. admonition:: Rule #3
    :class: FACT

    Requests which cause changes to the data definition
    -- create, alter, drop, truncate -- must not be used.

Below is a list of all functions for transaction management.
