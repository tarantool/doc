The ``vshard`` module introduces an advanced sharding feature based on
the concept of :ref:`virtual buckets <vshard-vbuckets>` and enables horizontal
scaling in Tarantool.

To learn how sharding works in Tarantool, refer to the :ref:`Sharding <sharding>` page.

You can also check out the :ref:`Quick start guide <vshard-quick-start>` -- or dive into the
