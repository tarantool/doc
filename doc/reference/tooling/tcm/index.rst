|tcm_full_name| (|tcm|) is a web-based visual tool for configuring, managing, and
monitoring Tarantool EE clusters. It provides a GUI for working with clusters
and individual instances, from monitoring their state to executing commands interactively
in an instance's console.

|tcm| is a standalone application included in the Tarantool Enterprise Edition
:ref:`distribution package <enterprise-package-contents>`. It is shipped as ready-to-run
executable for Linux platforms.

|tcm| works only with Tarantool EE clusters that use centralized configuration in
:ref:`etcd <configuration_etcd>` or a Tarantool-based configuration storage.
When you create or edit a cluster's configuration in |tcm|, it publishes the saved
configuration to the storage. This ensures consistent and reliable configuration storage.
A single |tcm| installation can connect to multiple Tarantool EE clusters and
switch between them in one click.

To provide enterprise-grade security, |tcm| features its own role-based access control.
You can create users and assign them roles that include required permissions.
For example, a user can be an administrator of a specific cluster or only have the right
to read data. LDAP authorization is supported as well.
