tt CLI utility
==============

``tt`` is a utility that provides a unified command-line interface for managing
Tarantool-based applications. It covers a wide range of tasks -- from installing
a specific Tarantool version to managing remote instances and developing applications.

A multi-purpose tool for working with Tarantool from the command line, ``tt`` is
a potential replacement for :ref:`tarantoolctl <tarantoolctl>`
and :doc:`Cartridge CLI </book/cartridge/cartridge_cli/index>`.

``tt`` is developed in its own `GitHub repository <https://github.com/tarantool/tt>`_.
Here you can find its source code, the changelog, and usage examples.

In this section, you will find instructions on ``tt`` installation and configuration,
concept explanation, and the command reference.
