Tarantool 1.10.10
=================

Release: :tarantool-release:`1.10.10`

Date: 2021-04-21 Tag: 1.10.10

Overview
--------

1.10.10 is the next stable release in the
:doc:`long-term support (LTS) version </release/policy>`
1.10.x release series.

The label “stable” means there are 1.10.x-based applications running in
production for quite a while without known crashes, incorrect results or
other showstopper bugs.

This release introduces 12 improvements and resolves roughly 3 issues
since the 1.10.9 version.

Compatibility
-------------

Tarantool 1.10.x is backward compatible with Tarantool 1.9.x in binary
data layout, client-server protocol and replication protocol.

Please
`upgrade <https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/1.10/book/admin/upgrades/>`__
using the ``box.schema.upgrade()`` procedure to unlock all the new
features of the 1.10.x series.

Functionality added or changed
------------------------------

Build
~~~~~

-   Updated CMake minimum required version in Tarantool build
    infrastructure to 3.1.
-   Stop publishing new binary packages for CentOS 6.
-   Stop publishing new binary packages for Debian Jessie.
-   Publish binary packages for Fedora 33 (:tarantool-issue:`5502`).
-   Backported ``-DENABLE_LTO=ON/OFF`` cmake option (:tarantool-issue:`3117`,
    :tarantool-issue:`3743`).
    It is useful for building packages for Fedora 33 (:tarantool-issue:`5502`).
-   Bump built-in zstd version from v1.3.3 to v1.4.8
    (part of :tarantool-issue:`5502`).
-   libcurl symbols in the case of bundled libcurl are now exported
    (:tarantool-issue:`5223`, :tarantool-issue:`5542`).
-   Enable smtp and smtps protocols in bundled libcurl (:tarantool-issue:`4559`).
-   Ship libcurl headers to system path “${PREFIX}/include/tarantool” in
    the case of libcurl included as bundled library or static build
    (:tarantool-issue:`4559`).

Testing
~~~~~~~

-   We’re moving to GitHub Actions (:tarantool-issue:`5662`).
-   Implemented self-sufficient LuaJIT testing environment. As a result
    LuaJIT build system is partially ported to CMake and all testing
    machinery is enclosed within tarantool/luajit repository
    (:tarantool-issue:`4862`, :tarantool-issue:`5470`).
-   Switch to Python 3 by default in a test infrastructure (:tarantool-issue:`5652`)

Bugs fixed
----------

Core
~~~~

-   Extensive usage of ``uri`` and ``uuid`` modules with debug log level
    could lead to a crash or corrupted result of the functions from these
    modules. Also their usage from the callbacks passed to ``ffi.gc()``
    could lead to the same but much easier. The same could happen with
    some functions from the modules ``fio``, ``box.tuple``, ``iconv``
    (:tarantool-issue:`5632`).

Lua
~~~

-   Fixed -e option, when tarantool always entered interactive mode when
    stdin is a tty. Now, ``tarantool -e 'print"Hello"'`` doesn’t enter
    interactive mode as it was before, just prints ‘Hello’ and exits
    (:tarantool-issue:`5040`).

..  _build-1:

Build
~~~~~

-   Make recovering with force_recovery option delete newer than snapshot
    vylog files. So that instance can recover after incidents during
    checkpoint (:tarantool-issue:`5823`).
