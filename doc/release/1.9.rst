**Release 1.9.0**

Release type: stable. Release date: 2018-02-26.  Tag: 1.9.0-4-g195d446.

Announcement: https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/releases/tag/1.9.0.

This is the successor of the 1.7.6 stable release.
The goal of this release is increased maturity of vinyl and master-master replication,
and it contributes a number of features to this cause. Please follow the download
instructions at https://tarantool.io/en/download/download.html to download and install
a package for your operating system.

Functionality added or changed:

  * (Security) it is now possible to
    :ref:`block/unblock <authentication-owners_privileges>` users.
    Issue `2898 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2898>`_.
  * (Security) new function :ref:`box.session.euid() <box_session-euid>` to return effective user.
    Effective user can be different from authenticated user in case of ``setuid``
    functions or ``box.session.su``.
    Issue `2994 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2994>`_.
  * (Security) new :ref:`super <box_space-user>` role, with superuser access. Grant 'super' to guest to
    disable access control.
    Issue `3022 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/3022>`_.
  * (Security) :ref:`on_auth <box_session-on_auth>` trigger is now fired in case of both successful and
    failed authentication.
    Issue `3039 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/3039>`_.
  * (Replication/recovery) new replication configuration algorithm: if replication
    doesn't connect to replication_quorum peers in :ref:`replication_connect_timeout <cfg_replication-replication_connect_timeout>`
    seconds, the server start continues but the server enters the new :ref:`orphan <replication-orphan_status>` status,
    which is basically read-only, until the replicas connect to each other.
    Issues `3151 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/3151>`_ and
    `2958 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2958>`_.
  * (Replication/recovery) after replication connect at startup, the server does
    not start processing write requests before
    :ref:`syncing up <replication-orphan_status>` syncing up with all connected peers.
  * (Replication/recovery) it is now possible to explicitly set
    :ref:`instance_uuid <cfg_replication-instance_uuid>` and
    :ref:`replica set uuid <cfg_replication-replicaset_uuid>` as configuration parameters.
    Issue `2967 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2967>`_.
  * (Replication/recovery) :ref:`box.once() <box-once>` no longer fails on a read-only replica
    but waits.
    Issue `2537 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2537>`_.
  * (Replication/recovery) :ref:`force_recovery <cfg_binary_logging_snapshots-force_recovery>` can now skip a corrupted xlog file.
    Issue `3076 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/3076>`_.
  * (Replication/recovery) improved replication monitoring: :ref:`box.info.replication <box_info_replication>`
    shows peer ip:port and correct replication lag even for idle peers.
    Issues `2753 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2753>`_ and
    `2689 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2689>`_.
  * (Application server) new :ref:`before <box_space-before_replace>` triggers which can be used for conflict
    resolution in master-master replication.
    Issue `2993 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2993>`_.
  * (Application server) :ref:`http client <http-module>` now correctly parses cookies and supports
    http+unix:// paths.
    Issues `3040 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/3040>`_ and
    `2801 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2801>`_.
  * (Application server) ``fio`` rock now supports ``file_exists()``,
    ``rename()`` works across filesystems, and ``read()`` without arguments
    reads the whole file.
    Issues `2924 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2924>`_,
    `2751 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2751>`_ and
    `2925 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2925>`_.
  * (Application server) ``fio`` rock errors now follow Tarantool function call
    conventions and always return an error message in addition to the error flag.
  * (Application server) ``digest`` rock now supports pbkdf2 password hashing
    algorithm, useful in PCI/DSS compliant applications.
    Issue `2874 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2874>`_.
  * (Application server) :ref:`box.info.memory() <box_info_memory>` provides a high-level overview of
    server memory usage, including networking, Lua, transaction and index memory.
    Issue `934 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/934>`_.
  * (Database) it is now possible to :ref:`add missing tuple fields <box_space-is_nullable>` to an index,
    which is very useful when adding an index along with the evolution of the
    database schema.
    Issue `2988 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2988>`_.
  * (Database) lots of improvements in field type support when creating or
    :ref:`altering <box_index-alter>` spaces and indexes.
    Issues `2893 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2893>`_,
    `3011 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/3011>`_ and
    `3008 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/3008>`_.
  * (Database) it is now possible to turn on :ref:`is_nullable <box_space-is_nullable>` property on a field
    even if the space is not empty, the change is instantaneous.
    Issue `2973 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2973>`_.
  * (Database) :ref:`logging <log-module>` has been improved in many respects: individual messages
    (issues `1972 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/1972>`_,
    `2743 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2743>`_,
    `2900 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2900>`_),
    more logging in cases when it was useful
    (issues `3096 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/3096>`_,
    `2871 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2871>`_).
  * (Vinyl storage engine) it is now possible to make a :ref:`unique <box_index-unique>` vinyl index
    non-unique without index rebuild.
    Issue `2449 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2449>`_.
  * (Vinyl storage engine) improved UPDATE, REPLACE and recovery performance in
    presence of secondary keys.
    Issues `2289 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2289>`_,
    `2875 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2875>`_ and
    `3154 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/3154>`_.
  * (Vinyl storage engine) :ref:`space:len() <box_space-len>` and
    :ref:`space:bsize() <box_space-bsize>` now work for
    vinyl (although they are still not exact).
    Issue `3056 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/3056>`_.
  * (Vinyl storage engine) recovery speed has improved in presence of secondary
    keys.
