Functionality added or changed
------------------------------

Build
~~~~~

-  RedOS 7.3 is now supported.
-  Added the ``-DENABLE_HARDENING=ON/OFF`` CMake option that enables
   hardening against memory corruption attacks (:tarantool-issue:`7536`).

Bugs fixed
----------

Core
~~~~

-  Fixed a bug introduced in Tarantool 2.10.2: log messages could be
   written to data files thus causing data corruption. The issue was
   fixed by reverting the fix for :tarantool-issue:`4450`.
-  Switched from MT-Unsafe ``strerror()`` to MT-Safe ``strerror_r()``.
   The usage of the unsafe function could result in corrupted error
   messages.
-  Fixed a bug when a single JSON update couldn’t insert and update a
   field of a map or an array in two sequential calls. It would either
   crash or return an error (:tarantool-issue:`7705`).

Memtx
~~~~~

-  Fixed incorrect handling of transaction conflicts in full scans by
   HASH indexes (:tarantool-issue:`7493`).
-  Fixed ``use after free`` that could occur in the transaction manager
   in certain states (:tarantool-issue:`7449`).
-  Fixed possible phantom reads with ``get`` on TREE indexes containing
   nullable parts (:tarantool-issue:`7685`).
-  Fixed an inconsistency in ``index:random`` in the context of
   transaction management (:tarantool-issue:`7670`).
-  Fixed unserializable reads tracked incorrectly after transaction
   rollbacks (:tarantool-issue:`7343`).

Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Fixed a bug when a fiber committing a synchronous transaction could
   hang if the instance got a term bump during that or its synchro-queue
   was fenced in any other way (:tarantool-issue:`7253`).
-  Fixed master occasionally deleting xlogs needed by replicas even
   without a restart (:tarantool-issue:`7584`).

Raft
~~~~

-  Fixed a bug when ``box.ctl.promote()`` could hang and bump thousands
   of terms in a row if called on more than one node at the same time
   (part of :tarantool-issue:`7253`).
-  Fixed a bug when a node with ``election_mode='voter'`` could hang in
   ``box.ctl.promote()`` or become a leader (part of :tarantool-issue:`7253`).
-  Fixed a bug when a replicaset could be split into parts if a node
   voted for another instance while having local WAL writes unfinished
   (part of :tarantool-issue:`7253`).

Lua
~~~

Merger
^^^^^^

-  Fixed ``use after free`` that could occur during iteration over
   ``merge_source:pairs()`` or ``merger:pairs()`` (:tarantool-issue:`7657`).

Popen
^^^^^

-  Fixed a race condition in ``<popen handle>:signal()`` on Mac OS 12
   and newer (:tarantool-issue:`7658`).

Box
~~~

-  Fixed a bug when ``fiber.yield()`` might break the execution of a
   shutdown trigger (:tarantool-issue:`7434`).
-  Fixed a possible high CPU usage caused by shutdown triggers
   (:tarantool-issue:`6801`).

Synchro
~~~~~~~

-  Fixed assertions in debug builds and undefined behaviour in release
   builds when simultaneous elections started or another instance was
   promoted while an instance was acquiring or releasing the synchro
   queue (:tarantool-issue:`7086`).

Uri
~~~

-  Fixed a bug in the URI parser: tarantoolctl could not connect when
   the host name was skipped (:tarantool-issue:`7479`).
