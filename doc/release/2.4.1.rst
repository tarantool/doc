Functionality added or changed
------------------------------

Core
~~~~

-   Possibility to create errors of a custom user type (:tarantool-issue:`4398`). Read more:

    -   :ref:`box_protocol-responses_error`
    -   :ref:`MessagePack extensions (ERROR type) <msgpack_ext-error>`
    -   :doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_error/new`.

-   Transparent marshalling error through net.box (:tarantool-issue:`4398`). Read more:

    -   :doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_error/new`
    -   :ref:`MessagePack extensions (ERROR type) <msgpack_ext-error>`.

-   ``box_session_push()``: a new public C API function. It takes
    ``const char * MessagePack`` and returns it to the client out of
    order, just like the Lua ``box.session.push()`` does (:tarantool-issue:`4734`). Read more:
    :ref:`box_session_push() <box_box_session_push>`.
-   Introduce a new field type and a new index type: UUID (:tarantool-issue:`4268`,
    :tarantool-issue:`2916`). Read more:

    -   :ref:`UUID field type <index-box_uuid>`
    -   :ref:`mapping UUID field to index types <index-box_indexed-field-types>`
    -   :ref:`uuid.new() <uuid-new>`

-   Add ability to encode/decode UUIDs to MsgPack (:tarantool-issue:`4268`, :tarantool-issue:`2916`). Read more:
    :ref:`MessagePack extensions (UUID type) <msgpack_ext-uuid>`.
-   Introduce stacked diagnostic area: now each Lua table representing an
    error object features the ``.prev`` member and the ``:set_prev()``
    method so that errors can be organized into lists. IProto protocol is
    extended with new command keys to support this feature as well
    (:tarantool-issue:`1148`). For details, refer to :doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_error/error_object`.

Lua
~~~

-   Added ``popen`` built-in module (:tarantool-issue:`4031`).

    The module provides popen implementation that is integrated with
    tarantool’s event loop (like built-in ``fio`` and ``socket``
    modules).

    It support bidirectional communication with a process: the module can
    feed input to a process and capture its output. This way it allows to
    run streaming programs (like ``grep``) and even work interactively
    with outside REPL (say, ``python -i``).

    A key feature of the implementation is that it uses vfork() under
    hood and so does not copy virtual memory tables. Copying of them may
    be quite time consuming: os.execute() takes ~2.5 seconds when 80 GiB
    is allocated for memtx. Moreover, when memory overcommit is disabled
    (which is default) it would be not possible to fork a process when
    more then half of available physical memory is mapped to tarantool’s
    process.

    The API should be considered as beta: it is quite basic and will be
    extended with convenience features. On the other hand, it may be
    changed in a backward-incompatible manner in the future releases if
    it will be valuable enough.

    For more details, refer to the ``popen`` module :doc:`documentation </reference/reference_lua/popen>`.

-   ``fio`` descriptors are closed on garbage collection (:tarantool-issue:`4727`). Read more
    in description of :ref:`fio.open() <fio-open>`.

-   :ref:`fio.tempdir() <fio-tempdir>` uses the ``$TMPDIR`` environment variable
    as a path indication to create temporary directories (:tarantool-issue:`4794`).

-   Expose ``lua_checktuple`` function (:tarantool-issue:`2553`).

-   :ref:`fiber.name <fiber_object-name_set>` maximal length is extended to 255 (:tarantool-issue:`4394`).

-   Add ``tarantoolctl rocks`` commands: ``build``, ``config``,
    ``download``, ``init``, ``lint``, ``new_version``, ``purge``,
    ``which``, ``write_rockspec`` (:tarantool-issue:`4629`). Read more in :ref:`tarantoolctl-module_management`.

Misc
~~~~

-   ``box.info.listen``: a new variable in the ``box.info``. Shows the
    real port when bound to the port ``0``. For example, if the
    ``listen`` parameter of ``box.cfg`` is set to ``127.0.0.1:0``, the
    ``box.info.listen`` shows ``127.0.0.1:<real_port>`` (:tarantool-issue:`4620`).
    Read more: :doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_info/listen`.
-   ``sequence:current()``: a new function to get the current sequence
    value without changing it (:tarantool-issue:`4752`). Read more: :doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_schema_sequence/current`.

Bugs fixed
----------


Core
~~~~

-   :ref:`fiber.storage <fiber_object-storage>` is cleaned between requests,
    and can be used as a
    request-local storage. Previously ``fiber.storage`` could contain
    some old values in the beginning of an iproto request execution, and
    it needed to be nullified manually. Now the cleanup is unneeded
    (:tarantool-issue:`4662`).
-   ``tuple``/``space``/``index``:``update()``/``upsert()`` were fixed
    not to turn a value into an infinity when a float value was added to
    or subtracted from a float column and exceeded the float value range
    (:tarantool-issue:`4701`).
-   Fix potential execution abort when operating the system runs under
    heavy memory load (:tarantool-issue:`4722`).
-   Make RTREE indexes handle the out of memory error: before this fix,
    OOM during the recovery of an RTREE index resulted in segmentation
    fault (:tarantool-issue:`4619`).
-   Fix the error message returned on using an already dropped sequence
    (:tarantool-issue:`4753`).
-   Add cancellation guard to avoid WAL thread stuck (:tarantool-issue:`4127`).
-   Fix execution abort when ``memtx_memory`` and ``vinyl_memory`` are
    set to more than 4398046510080 bytes. Now an error message is
    returned (:tarantool-issue:`4705`).
-   ``box.error.new()`` does not add a created error to the Tarantool’s
    diagnostic area anymore (:tarantool-issue:`4778`). Read more:

    - :doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_error/new`
    - :doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_error/set`.

-   Add Lua output format support for ``box.session.push()`` (:tarantool-issue:`4686`).

Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~

-   Fix rebootstrap procedure not working in case replica itself is
    listed in ``box.cfg.replication`` (:tarantool-issue:`4759`).
-   Fix possible user password leaking via replication logs (:tarantool-issue:`4493`).
-   Refactor ``vclock`` map to be exactly 4 bytes in size to fit all 32
    replicas regardless of the compiler used
    (see in this `commit <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/commit/e5679980aa5f813553a95ab7d31f111dd0893df6>`__).
-   Fix crash when the replication applier rollbacks a transaction
    (:tarantool-issue:`4730`, :tarantool-issue:`4776`).
-   Fix segmentation fault on master side when one of the replicas
    transitions from anonymous to normal (:tarantool-issue:`4731`).
-   Local space operations are now counted in 0th vclock component. Every
    instance may have its own 0-th vclock component not matching others’.
    Local space operations are not replicated at all, even as NOPs
    (:tarantool-issue:`4114`).
-   Gc consumers are now ordered by their vclocks and not by vclock
    signatures. Only the WALS that contain no entries needed by any of
    the consumers are deleted (:tarantool-issue:`4114`).


Lua
~~~

-   json: ``:decode()`` does not spoil instance’s options with per-call
    ones (when it is called with the second argument) (:tarantool-issue:`4761`).
-   Handle empty input for ``uri.format()`` properly (:tarantool-issue:`4779`).
-   ``os.environ()`` is now changed when ``os.setenv()`` is called
    (:tarantool-issue:`4733`).
-   ``netbox.self:call/eval()`` now returns the same types as
    ``netbox_connection:call``/``eval``. Previously it could return a
    tuple or ``box.error`` cdata (:tarantool-issue:`4513`).
-   ``box.tuple.*`` namespace is cleaned up from private functions.
    :doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_tuple/is` description is added to documentation (:tarantool-issue:`4684`).
-   ``tarantoolctl rocks search``: fix the ``--all`` flag (:tarantool-issue:`4529`).
-   ``tarantoolctl rocks remove``: fix the ``--force`` flag (:tarantool-issue:`3632`).
-   libev: backport fix for listening for more then 1024 file descriptors
    on Mac OS (:tarantool-issue:`3867`).

SQL
~~~

-   Fix ``box.stat()`` behavior: now it collects statistics on the
    ``PREPARE`` and ``EXECUTE`` methods as expected (:tarantool-issue:`4756`).
-   Add ability to drop any table constraint using the following
    statement:
    ``ALTER TABLE  <table_name> DROP CONSTRAINT <constraint_name>``.
    Previously, it was possible to drop only foreign key constraints with
    such a statement (:tarantool-issue:`4120`). Read more in :ref:`Alter Table <sql_alter_table>`.
-   “No such constraint” error now contains the name of the table this
    constraint belongs to.
-   Add an empty body to the ``UNPREPARE`` IProto response (:tarantool-issue:`4769`).
-   Reset all the placeholders’ bound values after execution of a
    prepared statement (:tarantool-issue:`4825`).
-   The inserted values are inserted in the order in which they are given
    in case of INSERT into space with autoincrement (:tarantool-issue:`4256`).

Types related changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   Rework the ``NUMBER`` type in SQL: now it completely matches with
    NoSQL definition. Integers inserted into a field of the ``NUMBER``
    type are no longer forced to floating point representation;
    ``CAST AS NUMBER`` operation applied to an integer value doesn’t
    change it; ``CAST AS NUMBER`` operation applied to a boolean value
    now converts it into ``1``, ``0`` or ``NULL`` depending on particular
    boolean value (:tarantool-issue:`4233`). Read more in
    :ref:`Data Type Conversion <sql_data_type_conversion>`.

-   Fix the ``CAST AS NUMBER`` operation applied to blob values: floating
    point representation of the result is no longer forced (:tarantool-issue:`4463`).

-   Fix integer overflow error during addition of the integer and
    floating point values stored in the ``SCALAR`` column (:tarantool-issue:`4369`).

-   Explicit and implicit cast from string containing floating point
    value to integer or unsigned types are disallowed.

-   Maximum length of a blob value that is allowed to be cast to integer
    or unsigned types are limited to 12287 bytes.

-   Fix wrong result of CAST() operator from blob to integer type in case
    a blob value does not have terminating ‘\\0’ (:tarantool-issue:`4766`).

HTTP client
^^^^^^^^^^^

-   When building Tarantool with bundled ``libcurl``, link it with the
    ``c-ares`` library by default (:tarantool-issue:`4591`).

LuaJIT
~~~~~~

-   ``__pairs``/``__ipairs`` metamethods handling is removed since we
    faced the issues with the backward compatibility between Lua 5.1 and
    Lua 5.2 within Tarantool modules as well as other third party code
    (:tarantool-issue:`4770`).

-   Introduce ``luajit-gdb.py`` extension with commands for inspecting
    LuaJIT internals. The extension obliges one to provide gdbinfo for
    ``libluajit``, otherwise loading fails. The extension provides the
    following commands:

    -   ``lj-arch`` dumps values of LJ_64 and LJ_GC64 macro definitions
    -   ``lj-tv`` dumps the type and GCobj info related to the given
        TValue
    -   ``lj-str`` dumps the contents of the given GCstr
    -   ``lj-tab`` dumps the contents of the given GCtab
    -   ``lj-stack`` dumps Lua stack of the given lua_State
    -   ``lj-state`` shows current VM, GC and JIT states
    -   ``lj-gc`` shows current GC stats

-   Fix string to number conversion: current implementation respects the
    buffer length (:tarantool-issue:`4773`).

-   “FFI sandwich” (\*) detection is introduced. If sandwich is detected
    while trace recording the recording is aborted. The sandwich detected
    while mcode execution leads to the platform panic.

-   luaJIT_setmode call is prohibited while mcode execution and leads to
    the platform panic.

(\*) The following stack mix is called FFI sandwich:
``Lua-FFI -> C routine -> Lua-C API -> Lua VM``.

This sort of re-entrancy is explicitly not supported by LuaJIT compiler.
For more info see :tarantool-issue:`4427`.

Vinyl
~~~~~

-   Fix assertion fault due to triggered dump process during secondary
    index build (:tarantool-issue:`4810`).


Misc
~~~~

-   Fix crashes at attempts to use ``-e`` and ``-l`` command line options
    concatenated with their values, like this: ``-eprint(100)``
    (:tarantool-issue:`4775`).
-   Fix inability to upgrade from 2.1 if there was an automatically
    generated sequence (:tarantool-issue:`4771`).
-   Prettify the error message for ``user.grant()``: no extra ’ ’ for
    universal privileges (:tarantool-issue:`714`).
-   Update ``libopenssl`` version to 1.1.1f since the previous one was
    EOLed (:tarantool-issue:`4830`).

Building from sources
---------------------

-   Update the ``decNumber`` library to silence the build warning
    produced on too long integer constant
    (see in this `commit <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/commit/aab03a735c7a215b4371ef834f7d08432b1bf0f7>`_).
-   Fix static build (``-DBUILD_STATIC=ON``) when ``libunwind`` depends
    on ``liblzma`` (:tarantool-issue:`4551`).
