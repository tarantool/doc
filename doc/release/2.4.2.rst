Tarantool 2.4.2
===============

Release: :tarantool-release:`2.4.2`
Date: 2020-07-17 Tag: 2.4.2-1-g3f00d29

Overview
--------

2.4.2 is the first stable version of the 2.4 release series. The label
stable means we have all planned features implemented and we see no
high-impact issues.

This release resolves roughly 32 issues since the latest beta version.
There may be bugs in less common areas, please feel free to file an
issue at `GitHub <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues>`_.

Compatibility
-------------

Tarantool 2.x is backward compatible with Tarantool 1.10.x in binary
data layout, client-server protocol and replication protocol.

Please
`upgrade <https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/2.3/book/admin/upgrades/>`_
using the box.schema.upgrade() procedure to unlock all the new features
of the 2.x series.

Functionality added or changed
------------------------------

Core
~~~~

-   :doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_session/push` parameter ``sync``
    is deprecated. A warning is printed when the sync is used, but it still works.
    It is removed in the next version (:tarantool-issue:`4689`).

Misc
~~~~

-   Don’t start :ref:`‘example’ instance <creating-db-locally>` after
    installing Tarantool (:tarantool-issue:`4507`).

    Before this release tarantool package for Debian and Ubuntu
    automatically enable and start ‘example’ instance, which listens on
    the TCP port 3301. Starting from this release the instance file is
    installed to /etc/tarantool/instances.available/example.lua, but is
    not enabled by default and not started anymore. One may perform the
    following actions to enable and start it:

    ..  code-block:: bash


        ln -s /etc/tarantool/instances.available/example.lua \
            /etc/tarantool/instances.enabled/example.lua
        systemctl start tarantool@example

    Existing configuration will not be updated automatically at package
    update, so manual actions are required to stop and disable the
    instance (if it is not needed, of course):

    ..  code-block:: bash


        systemctl stop tarantool@example
        rm /etc/tarantool/instances.enabled/example.lua

Vinyl
~~~~~

-   Fixed crash during compaction due to tuples with size exceeding
    vinyl_max_tuple_size setting (:tarantool-issue:`4864`).
-   Fixed crash during recovery of vinyl index due to the lack of file
    descriptors (:tarantool-issue:`4805`).
-   Fixed crash during executing upsert changing primary key in debug

    (:tarantool-issue:`3395`).
-   Fixed squashing set and arithmetic upsert operations (:tarantool-issue:`5106`).

    the same key (:tarantool-issue:`4957`).

Memtx
~~~~~

-   Fixed concurrent replaces on index building. Tuples are now
    referenced on all needed execution paths (:tarantool-issue:`4973`).
