Tarantool 2.4.3
===============

Announcement: https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/releases/tag/2.4.3
Date: 2020-10-22 Tag: 2.4.3-1-g986fab7

Overview
--------

This release resolves roughly 13 issues since the 2.4.2 version. There
may be bugs in less common areas. If you find any, feel free to report
an issue at `GitHub <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues>`_.

Compatibility
-------------

Tarantool 2.x is backward compatible with Tarantool 1.10.x in the binary
data layout, client-server protocol, and replication protocol.

Please
`upgrade <https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/book/admin/upgrades/>`_
using the ``box.schema.upgrade()`` procedure to unlock all the new
features of the 2.x series.

Functionality added or changed
------------------------------

Module API
~~~~~~~~~~

-   Exposed the box region, key_def and several other functions in order
    to implement external tuple.keydef and tuple.merger modules on top of
    them (:tarantool-issue:`5273`, :tarantool-issue:`5384`).

Bugs fixed
----------

Core
~~~~

-   Fixed a crash when JSON tuple field access was used to get a multikey
    indexed field, and when a JSON contained [*] in the beginning
    (:tarantool-issue:`5224`).
-   Fixed msgpack extension types decoding error message (:tarantool-issue:`5016`).
-   Dropped restrictions on nullable multikey index root. They were
    introduced due to inaccuracy in multikey index realization. It is now
    fixed. Also all fields are now nullable by default as it was before
    2.2.1 (:tarantool-issue:`5192`).
-   Fixed fibers switch-over to prevent JIT machinery misbehavior. Trace
    recording is aborted when fiber yields the execution. The yield
    occurring while the compiled code is being run (it’s likely a
    function with a yield underneath called via LuaJIT FFI) leads to the
    platform panic (:tarantool-issue:`1700`, :tarantool-issue:`4491`).
-   Fixed fibers switch-over to prevent implicit GC disabling. The yield
    occurring while user-defined \__gc metamethod is running leads to the
    platform panic.

Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~

-   Anonymous replica could be registered and could prevent WAL files
    removal (:tarantool-issue:`5287`).
-   XlogGapError is not a critical error anymore. It means,
    box.info.replication will show upstream status as ‘loading’ if the
    error was found. The upstream will be restarted until the error is
    resolved automatically with a help of another instance, or until the
    replica is removed from box.cfg.replication (:tarantool-issue:`5287`).

LuaJIT
~~~~~~

-   Fixed the error occurring on loading luajit-gdb.py with Python2
    (:tarantool-issue:`4828`).

Lua
~~~

-   Fixed unhandled Lua error that may lead to memory leaks and
    inconsistencies in ``<space_object>:frommap()``,
    ``<key_def_object>:compare()``, ``<merge_source>:select()``
    (:tarantool-issue:`5382`).

SQL
~~~

-   SQL view are not alterable anymore. Beforehand it led to undefined
    behavior.

Misc
~~~~

-   Fixed potential lag on boot up procedure when system’s password
    database is slow in access (:tarantool-issue:`5034`).


Module API
~~~~~~~~~~

-   Get rid of typedef redefinitions for compatibility with C99
    (:tarantool-issue:`5313`).
