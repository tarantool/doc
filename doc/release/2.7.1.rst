-   The :ref:`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN <sql_alter_table>` statement.

Compatibility
-------------

Tarantool 2.x is backward compatible with Tarantool 1.10.x in the binary
data layout, client-server protocol, and replication protocol.

Please
`upgrade <https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/book/admin/upgrades/>`_
using the ``box.schema.upgrade()`` procedure to unlock all the new
features of the 2.x series.

Functionality added or changed
------------------------------

Core
~~~~

-   Now it is allowed to define an index without extra braces when there
    is only one part: ``parts = {field1, type1, ...}`` (:tarantool-issue:`2866`). Read more in
    the :ref:`note about index parts declaration <index_parts_declaration_note>`.
-   :ref:`Bitset index <indexes-bitset>` now supports the varbinary type (:tarantool-issue:`5392`).
-   Index-related options now can’t be specified in their definition due
    to a more pedantic key-parts verification (:tarantool-issue:`5473`).
-   A warning is now logged when schema version is older than last
    available schema version (:tarantool-issue:`4574`).
-   UUID values created via ``uuid`` Lua module (``require('uuid')``) can
    now be compared using the comparison operators like ``<``, ``>=``,
    and others (:tarantool-issue:`5511`).
-   The new ``box.ctl.is_recovery_finished()`` function allows user to
    determine whether memtx recovery is finished.
-   The ``force_recovery`` option now ignores errors during snapshot
    recovery (:tarantool-issue:`5422`).
-   Feedback daemon now reports ``box.stat().*.total``,
    ``box.stat.net().*.total``, and ``box.stat.net().*.current`` together
    with the time of report generation. The added fields reside in
    ``feedback.stats.box``, ``feedback.stats.net``, and
    ``feedback.stats.time`` (:tarantool-issue:`5589`).

LuaJIT
~~~~~~

-   Introduced the LuaJIT memory profiler (:tarantool-issue:`5442`) and the profile
    parser (:tarantool-issue:`5490`).
    Read more: :ref:`LuaJIT memory profiler <luajit_memprof>`.

Lua
~~~

-   Show JSON tokens themselves instead of token names ``T_*`` in the
    JSON decoder error messages (:tarantool-issue:`4339`).
-   Show a decoding context in the JSON decoder error messages (:tarantool-issue:`4339`).

SQL
~~~

-   The :ref:`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN <sql_alter_table>` statement is now
    supported for empty tables (:tarantool-issue:`2349`, :tarantool-issue:`3075`).

Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~

-   It is now possible to specify synchro quorum as a function of a
    number ``N`` of registered replicas instead of a ``const`` number,
    for example:

    ..  code:: lua

        box.cfg{replication_synchro_quorum = "N/2 + 1"}

    Only the non-anonymous bootstrapped replicas amount to ``N``. The
    expression should respect synchro guarantees: at least 50% of the
    cluster size + 1. The expression value is re-evaluated automatically
    inside of Tarantool when new replicas appear or old ones are removed
    (:tarantool-issue:`5446`).

Build
~~~~~

-   Deploy packages for Fedora 32 (:tarantool-issue:`4966`).
-   Deploy packages for Debian Bullseye (:tarantool-issue:`5638`).

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   If Tarantool crashes, it will now send a crash dump report to the
    feedback server. This report contains some fields from ``uname``
    output, build information, crash reason, and a stack trace. You can
    disable crash reporting with ``box.cfg{feedback_crashinfo = false}``
    (:tarantool-issue:`5261`).

Bugs fixed
----------


Core
~~~~

-   ``fiber.cond:wait()`` now correctly throws an error when a fiber is
    cancelled, instead of ignoring the timeout and returning without any
    signs of an error (:tarantool-issue:`5013`).
-   Fixed a memory corruption issue, which was most visible on macOS, but
    could affect any system (:tarantool-issue:`5312`).
-   A dynamic module now gets correctly unloaded from memory in case of
    an attempt to load a non-existing function from it (:tarantool-issue:`5475`).
-   A ``swim:quit()`` call now can’t result in a crash (:tarantool-issue:`4570`).
-   Snapshot recovery with no JSONPath or multikey indices involved now
    has normal performance (:tarantool-issue:`4774`).


Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~

-   A false-positive “too long WAL write” message no longer appears for
    synchronous transactions (:tarantool-issue:`5139`).
-   A ``box.ctl.wait_rw()`` call could return when the instance was not
    in fact writable due to having foreign synchronous transactions. As a
    result, there was no proper way to wait until the automatically
    elected leader would become writable. Now ``box.ctl.wait_rw()`` works
    correctly (:tarantool-issue:`5440`).
-   Fixed a couple of crashes on various tweaks of election mode
    (:tarantool-issue:`5506`).
-   Now ``box.ctl.clear_synchro_queue`` tries to commit everything that
    is present on the node. In order to do so it waits for other
    instances to replicate the data for ``replication_synchro_quorum``
    seconds. In case timeout passes and quorum wasn’t reached, nothing is
    rolled back (:tarantool-issue:`5435`).


SQL
~~~

-   Data changes in read-only mode are now forbidden (:tarantool-issue:`5231`).
-   Query execution now does not occasionally raise an unrelated error
    “Space ‘0’ does not exist” (:tarantool-issue:`5592`).
-   Coinciding names of temporary files (used to store data during
    execution) having two instances running on the same machine no longer
    cause a segfault (:tarantool-issue:`5537`).
-   The return value of ``ifnull()`` built-in function is now of a
    correct type.
-   SQL calling Lua functions with box calls inside can no longer result
    in a memory corruption (:tarantool-issue:`5427`).


LuaJIT
~~~~~~

-   Dispatching ``__call`` metamethod no longer causes address clashing
    (:tarantool-issue:`4518`, :tarantool-issue:`4649`).
-   Fixed a false positive panic when yielding in debug hook (:tarantool-issue:`5649`).


Lua
~~~

-   An attempt to use a ``net.box`` connection which is not established
    yet now results in a correctly reported error (:tarantool-issue:`4787`).
-   Fixed a ``NULL`` dereference on error paths in merger which usually
    happened on a ‘wrong’ ``key_def`` (:tarantool-issue:`5450`).
-   Calling ``key_def.compare_with_key()`` with an invalid key no longer
    causes a segfault (:tarantool-issue:`5307`).
-   Fixed a hang which occured when ``tarantool`` ran a user script with
    the ``-e`` option and this script exited with an error (like with
    ``tarantool -e 'assert(false)'``) (:tarantool-issue:`4983`).

Memtx
~~~~~

-   The ``on_schema_init`` triggers now can’t cause duplicates in primary
    key (:tarantool-issue:`5304`).
