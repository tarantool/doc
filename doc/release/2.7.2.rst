Tarantool 2.7.2
===============

Release: :tarantool-release:`2.7.2`

Date: 2021-04-21 Tag: 2.7.2

Overview
--------

2.7.2 is the first :doc:`stable </release/policy>`
version of the 2.7 release series. It introduces 15 improvements and
resolves 30 bugs since 2.7.1.

The “stable” label means that we have all planned features implemented
and we see no high-impact issues. However, if you encounter an issue,
feel free to `report
it <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues>`__ on GitHub.

Compatibility
-------------

Tarantool 2.x is backward compatible with Tarantool 1.10.x in the binary
data layout, client-server protocol, and replication protocol.

Please
`upgrade <https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/book/admin/upgrades/>`__
using the ``box.schema.upgrade()`` procedure to unlock all the new
features of the 2.x series.

Functionality added or changed
------------------------------

Core
~~~~

-   Introduce the concept of WAL queue and a new configuration option:
    ``wal_queue_max_size``, measured in bytes, with 16 Mb default. The
    option helps limit the pace at which replica submits new transactions
    to WAL: the limit is checked every time a transaction from master is
    submitted to replica’s WAL, and the space taken by a transaction is
    considered empty once it’s successfully written (:tarantool-issue:`5536`).

Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~

-   Introduce ``box.ctl.promote()`` and the concept of manual elections
    (enabled with ``election_mode='manual'``). Once the instance is in
    ``manual`` election mode, it acts like a ``voter`` most of the time,
    but may trigger elections and become a leader, once
    ``box.ctl.promote()`` is called. When ``election_mode ~= 'manual'``,
    ``box.ctl.promote()`` replaces ``box.ctl.clear_synchro_queue()``,
    which is now deprecated (:tarantool-issue:`3055`).

Build
~~~~~

-   Updated CMake minimum required version in Tarantool build
    infrastructure to 3.1.
-   Drop autotools dependencies from RPM / Deb packages (follows up
    :tarantool-issue:`4968`).
-   Stop publishing new binary packages for CentOS 6.
-   Stop publishing new binary packages for Debian Jessie.
-   Stop support of Mac OS 10.13 (disable regular testing).
-   Publish binary packages for Fedora 33 (:tarantool-issue:`5502`).
-   Bump built-in zstd version from v1.3.3 to v1.4.8 (part of :tarantool-issue:`5502`).
-   Enable smtp and smtps protocols in bundled libcurl (:tarantool-issue:`4559`).
-   Ship libcurl headers to system path “${PREFIX}/include/tarantool” in
    the case of libcurl included as bundled library or static build
    (:tarantool-issue:`4559`).

Testing
~~~~~~~

-   We’re moving to GitHub Actions (:tarantool-issue:`5662`).
-   Run single node Jepsen testing on per-push basis (:tarantool-issue:`5736`).
-   Implemented self-sufficient LuaJIT testing environment. As a result
    LuaJIT build system is partially ported to CMake and all testing
    machinery is enclosed within tarantool/luajit repository (:tarantool-issue:`4862`,
    :tarantool-issue:`5470`).
-   Switch to Python 3 by default in a test infrastructure. (:tarantool-issue:`5652`)

Bugs fixed
----------

.. _core-1:

Core
~~~~

-   Fix lbox_ctl_is_recovery_finished(): in some cases it might return
    true even if recovery was still in the progress.
-   Fix skipping index part options in case field type is not specified
    (:tarantool-issue:`5674`).
-   Fixed memory corruption in netbox. Because of the wrong order of the
    ffi.gc and ffi.cast calls memory of struct error, which was still
    used, was freed
-   Fix a bug in relay timing out while replica is joining or syncing
    with master (:tarantool-issue:`5762`).
-   Fixed missing “path” value of index schema fetched by netbox
    (:tarantool-issue:`5451`).
-   Extensive usage of ``uri`` and ``uuid`` modules with debug log level
    could lead to a crash or corrupted result of the functions from these
    modules. Also their usage from the callbacks passed to ``ffi.gc()``
    could lead to the same but much easier. The same could happen with
    some functions from the modules ``fio``, ``box.tuple``, ``iconv``
    (:tarantool-issue:`5632`).
-   Introduce ``wal_cleanup_delay`` option to prevent early cleanup of
    ``*.xlog`` files which are needed by replicas and lead to
    ``XlogGapError`` (:tarantool-issue:`5806`).
-   Fix a bug in applier erroring with ``Unknown request type 40`` during
    final join when master has synchronous spaces (:tarantool-issue:`5566`).
-   Add memtx mvcc tracking of read gaps which fixes problem of phantom
    reads (:tarantool-issue:`5628`).
-   Fix wrong result of using space:count() with memtx mvcc (:tarantool-issue:`5972`).
-   Fix dirty read after restart while using mvcc with synchronous
    replication (:tarantool-issue:`5973`).

.. _replication-1:

Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~

-   Fix applier hang on a replica after it fails to process CONFIRM or
    ROLLBACK message coming from a master.
-   Fix master not sending anonymous replica some rows when it fell
    behind and is trying to register.
-   Fix the bug when a synchronous transaction could be confirmed and
    visible on a replica, but then not confirmed / invisible again after
    restart. Could happen more likely on memtx spaces with
    ``memtx_use_mvcc_engine`` enabled (:tarantool-issue:`5213`).
-   Fix recovery of a rolled back multi-statement synchronous transaction
    which could lead to the transaction being applied partially, and to
    recovery errors. It happened in case the transaction worked with
    non-sync spaces (:tarantool-issue:`5874`).
-   Fix a bug in synchronous replication when rolled back transactions
    could reappear once a sufficiently old instance reconnected
    (:tarantool-issue:`5445`).

Swim
~~~~

-   Fix ``<swim_instance>:broadcast()`` which does not work on non-local
    addresses and spams “Permission denied” errors to the log. Also after
    instance termination it could return a non-0 exit code even if there
    was no errors in the script, and spam the error again (:tarantool-issue:`5864`).
-   Fix the crash on an attempt to call ``swim:member_by_uuid()`` with no
    arguments or with ``nil``/``box.NULL`` (:tarantool-issue:`5951`).
-   Fix the crash on an attempt to pass an object of a wrong type to
    ``__serialize`` method of a swim member in Lua (:tarantool-issue:`5952`).

LuaJIT
~~~~~~

-   Fixed memory profiler misbehaviour when Lua stack resize occurs
    (:tarantool-issue:`5842`).
-   Fixed double ``gc_cdatanum`` decrementing in LuaJIT platform metrics
    when a finalizer is set for GCcdata object (:tarantool-issue:`5820`).

Lua
~~~

-   Fixed -e option, when tarantool always entered interactive mode when
    stdin is a tty. Now, ``tarantool -e 'print"Hello"'`` doesn’t enter
    interactive mode as it was before, just prints ‘Hello’ and exits
    (:tarantool-issue:`5040`).
-   Fixed a leak of a tuple object in
    ``key_def:compare_with_key(tuple, key)``, when serialization of the
    key fails (:tarantool-issue:`5388`).

SQL
~~~

-   The string received by the user-defined C or Lua function could be
    different from the string passed to the function. This could happen
    if the string passed from SQL contains ‘\\0’ (:tarantool-issue:`5938`).
-   SQL SELECT or SQL UPDATE on UUID or DECIMAL field does not cause
    SEGMENTATION FAULT anymore (:tarantool-issue:`5011`, :tarantool-issue:`5704`, :tarantool-issue:`5913`).
-   Fix wrong result of SELECT with GROUP BY in case one of selected
    values is VARBINARY, which is not directly obtained from a space
    (:tarantool-issue:`5890`).

..  _build-1:

Build
~~~~~

-   Fix building on FreeBSD (incomplete definition of type ‘struct
    sockaddr’) (:tarantool-issue:`5748`).

-   Don’t refetch already downloaded static build dependencies (:tarantool-issue:`5761`).

-   Make recovering with force_recovery option delete newer than snapshot
    vylog files. So that instance can recover after incidents during
    checkpoint(:tarantool-issue:`5823`).

-   Fixed libcurl configuring, when tarantool itself is configured with
    ``cmake3`` command and there is no ``cmake`` command in PATH
    (:tarantool-issue:`5955`).

    This affects building tarantool from sources with bundled libcurl (it
    is the default mode).
