Release calendar

Release lifetime table
----------------------

The release lifetime table lists all Tarantool versions
starting from 1.10.x up to the current latest versions.
Each link leads to the release notes page of the corresponding version.
*End of life* means the release series will no longer receive any patches, updates,
or feature improvements after the specified date.
*End of support* means that we won't provide technical support to product versions
after the specified date.
