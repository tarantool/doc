EOL versions
============

This section contains information about Tarantool versions that have reached
their end of life in accordance with the :doc:`release policy <policy>`. This
means that these versions don't receive updates and fixes anymore. However, we still
provide technical support for most recent of them. Supported versions are shown in **bold**.

For information about major changes between EOL versions, see :ref:`releases_eol_major_features`.

.. note::

    Before 2.10.0, version numbers were subject to the :doc:`legacy versioning policy <legacy-policy>`.
