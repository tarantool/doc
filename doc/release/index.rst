Releases
========

This section contains information about Tarantool releases: release notes, lifecycle
information, release policy, and other documents.
To download Tarantool releases, check the `Download <https://www.tarantool.io/en/download/>`_ page.

All currently supported versions are listed on this page :ref:`below <release-supported-versions>`.
The information about earlier versions is provided in :ref:`release-eol-versions`.

The Enterprise Edition of Tarantool is distributed in the form of an SDK that has
its own versioning. See the :ref:`release-enterprise-changelog` to learn about
SDK version numbering and changes.

The detailed information about Tarantool version numbering and release lifecycle
is available in :ref:`release-policy`.

Backward compatibility is guaranteed between all versions in the same :term:`release series`.
It is also appreciated but not guaranteed between different release series (major number changes).
To learn more, read the :doc:`Compatibility guarantees <compatibility>` article.
