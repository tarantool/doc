Release lifetime table
----------------------

The release lifetime table lists all Tarantool versions
starting from 1.10.x up to the current latest versions.
Each link leads to the release notes page of the corresponding version.
End of series support means the release series will no longer receive any patches, updates, or feature improvements.
