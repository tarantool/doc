Managing Tarantool users
------------------------

|tcm| 1.2 introduces the ability to manage Tarantool users on connected clusters.
Previously, you could manage Tarantool users only though the Lua API (:ref:`box.schema <box_schema>` submodule)
or cluster :ref:`configuration <configuration_credentials_managing_users_roles>`.
Now you can create, edit, and delete users and roles on each instance of a Tarantool
cluster through the |tcm| web interface.

The tools for managing Tarantool users on a cluster instance are located on the
**Users** tab of the instance page.

Learn more about managing Tarantool users from |tcm| in :ref:`tcm_cluster_users`.

.. _tcm_releases_1_2_migrations:

Migrations
----------

Since version 1.2.0, |tcm| includes a page for editing and executing :ref:`migrations <migrations>`
on connected clusters. The new page **Migrations** in the **Cluster** page group
provides a text editor where you can write migration scripts in Lua and apply them
to the cluster.
