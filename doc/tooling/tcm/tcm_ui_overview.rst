Web interface overview
======================

..  include:: index.rst
    :start-after: ee_note_tcm_start
    :end-before: ee_note_tcm_end


The |tcm_full_name| web interface is available on the hostname and port defined by the
``http.host`` and ``http.port`` :ref:`configuration options <tcm_configuration>`.
If TLS is enabled, it uses the ``https`` protocol, otherwise the protocol is ``http``.
When started locally with the default configuration, |tcm| is available at ``http://127.0.0.1:8080``.

..  _tcm_ui_login:

Logging into TCM
----------------

To log into |tcm| after bootstrap, use the following credentials:

-   **Username**: ``admin``
-   **Password**: the initial password is shown in the |tcm| boot log in
    a message like this:

    .. code-block:: text

        Jun 11 11:24:08.900 WRN Generated super admin credentials login=admin password=jS9PsdkEJBYNhdMtSswMlxDR1vdbfc1N

After logging in with the default password:

#.  Adjust the :ref:`password policy <tcm_access_control_password_policy>`
    in accordance to the security requirements that apply in your organization.
#.  Change the ``admin`` user's password on the :ref:`User settings <tcm_ui_user_settings>` page.

To log out of |tcm|, click the user's name in the header and click **Log out**.

..  _tcm_ui_page_structure:

Page structure
--------------

#.  **Navigation page** on the left shows the list of pages available to the user.
    The navigation pane can be collapsed by clicking the cross icon at its top.
#.  **Header** at the top provides access to notifications and :ref:`user settings <tcm_ui_user_settings>`.

Page visibility
---------------

This overview describes most |tcm| pages. The exact set of pages and controls available
