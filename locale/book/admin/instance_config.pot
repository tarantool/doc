msgid "Instance file"
msgstr ""

msgid "After this short introduction, you may wonder what an instance file is, what it is for, and how ``tarantoolctl`` uses it. After all, Tarantool is an application server, so why not start the application stored in ``/usr/share/tarantool`` directly?"
msgstr ""

msgid "A typical Tarantool application is not a script, but a daemon running in background mode and processing requests, usually sent to it over a TCP/IP socket. This daemon needs to be started automatically when the operating system starts, and managed with the operating system standard tools for service management -- such as ``systemd`` or ``init.d``. To serve this very purpose, we created **instance files**."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can have more than one instance file. For example, a single application in ``/usr/share/tarantool`` can run in multiple instances, each of them having its own instance file. Or you can have multiple applications in ``/usr/share/tarantool`` -- again, each of them having its own instance file."
msgstr ""

msgid "An instance file is typically created by a system administrator. An application file is often provided by a developer, in a Lua rock or an rpm/deb package."
msgstr ""

msgid "An instance file is designed to not differ in any way from a Lua application. It must, however, configure the database, i.e. contain a call to :ref:`box.cfg{} <box_introspection-box_cfg>` somewhere in it, because it’s the only way to turn a Tarantool script into a background process, and ``tarantoolctl`` is a tool to manage background processes. Other than that, an instance file may contain arbitrary Lua code, and, in theory, even include the entire application business logic in it. We, however, do not recommend this, since it clutters the instance file and leads to unnecessary copy-paste when you need to run multiple instances of an application."
