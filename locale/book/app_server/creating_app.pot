msgid "Further we walk you through key programming practices that will give you a good start in writing Lua applications for Tarantool. For an adventure, this is a story of implementing... a real microservice based on Tarantool! We implement a backend for a simplified version of `Pokémon Go <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Go>`_, a location-based augmented reality game released in mid-2016. In this game, players use a mobile device's GPS capability to locate, capture, battle and train virtual monsters called \"pokémon\", who appear on the screen as if they were in the same real-world location as the player."
msgstr ""

msgid "To stay within the walk-through format, let's narrow the original gameplay as follows. We have a map with pokémon spawn locations. Next, we have multiple players who can send catch-a-pokémon requests to the server (which runs our Tarantool microservice). The server replies whether the pokémon is caught or not, increases the player's pokémon counter if yes, and triggers the respawn-a-pokémon method that spawns a new pokémon at the same location in a while."
msgstr ""

msgid "We leave client-side applications outside the scope of this story. Yet we promise a mini-demo in the end to simulate real users and give us some fun. :-)"
msgstr ""

msgid "First, what would be the best way to deliver our microservice?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Modules, rocks and applications"
msgstr ""

msgid "To make our game logic available to other developers and Lua applications, let's put it into a Lua module."
msgstr ""

msgid "A **module** (called \"rock\" in Lua) is an optional library which enhances Tarantool functionality. So, we can install our logic as a module in Tarantool and use it from any Tarantool application or module. Like applications, modules in Tarantool can be written in Lua (rocks), C or C++."
msgstr ""

msgid "Modules are good for two things:"
msgstr ""

msgid "easier **code management** (reuse, packaging, versioning), and"
msgstr ""

msgid "hot **code reload** without restarting the Tarantool instance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Technically, a module is a file with source code that exports its functions in an API. For example, here is a Lua module named ``mymodule.lua`` that exports one function named ``myfun``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "local exports = {}\n"
"exports.myfun = function(input_string)\n"
"   print('Hello', input_string)\n"
"end\n"
"return exports"
msgstr ""

msgid "To launch the function ``myfun()`` -- from another module, from a Lua application, or from Tarantool itself, -- we need to save this module as a file, then load this module with the ``require()`` directive and call the exported function."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, here's a Lua application that uses ``myfun()`` function from ``mymodule.lua`` module:"
msgstr ""

msgid "-- loading the module\n"
"local mymodule = require('mymodule')\n"
"\n"
"-- calling myfun() from within test() function\n"
"local test = function()\n"
"  mymodule.myfun()\n"
"end"
msgstr ""

msgid "A thing to remember here is that the ``require()`` directive takes load paths to Lua modules from the ``package.path`` variable. This is a semicolon-separated string, where a question mark is used to interpolate the module name. By default, this variable contains system-wide Lua paths and the working directory. But if we put our modules inside a specific folder (e.g. ``scripts/``), we need to add this folder to ``package.path`` before any calls to ``require()``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "package.path = 'scripts/?.lua;' .. package.path"
msgstr ""

msgid "For our microservice, a simple and convenient solution would be to put all methods in a Lua module (say ``pokemon.lua``) and to write a Lua application (say ``game.lua``) that initializes the gaming environment and starts the game loop."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now let's get down to implementation details. In our game, we need three entities:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**map**, which is an array of pokémons with coordinates of respawn locations; in this version of the game, let a location be a rectangle identified with two points, upper-left and lower-right;"
msgstr ""

msgid "**player**, which has an ID, a name, and coordinates of the player's location point;"
msgstr ""

msgid "**pokémon**, which has the same fields as the player, plus a status (active/inactive, that is present on the map or not) and a catch probability (well, let's give our pokémons a chance to escape :-) )"
msgstr ""

msgid "We'll store these entities as tuples in Tarantool spaces. But to deliver our backend application as a microservice, the good practice would be to send/receive our data in the universal JSON format, thus using Tarantool as a document storage."
msgstr ""

msgid "Avro schemas"
msgstr ""

msgid "To store JSON data as tuples, we will apply a savvy practice which reduces data footprint and ensures all stored documents are valid. We will use Tarantool module `avro-schema <https://github.com/tarantool/avro-schema>`_ which checks the schema of a JSON document and converts it to a Tarantool tuple. The tuple will contain only field values, and thus take a lot less space than the original document. In avro-schema terms, converting JSON documents to tuples is \"flattening\", and restoring the original documents is \"unflattening\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "First you need to `install <https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/1.10/book/app_server/installing_module/>`_ the module with ``tarantoolctl rocks install avro-schema``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Further usage is quite straightforward:"
msgstr ""

msgid "For each entity, we need to define a schema in `Apache Avro schema <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Avro>`_ syntax, where we list the entity's fields with their names and `Avro data types <http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/spec.html#schema_primitive>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "At initialization, we call ``avro-schema.create()`` that creates objects in memory for all schema entities, and ``compile()`` that generates flatten/unflatten methods for each entity."
msgstr ""

msgid "Further on, we just call flatten/unflatten methods for a respective entity on receiving/sending the entity's data."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here's what our schema definitions for the player and pokémon entities look like:"
msgstr ""

msgid "local schema = {\n"
"    player = {\n"

msgid "And here's how we create and compile our entities at initialization:"
msgstr ""

msgid "-- load avro-schema module with require()\n"
"local avro = require('avro_schema')\n"

"else\n"
"    log.info('Schema creation failed')\n"
"end\n"
"return false"
msgstr ""

msgid "As for the map entity, it would be an overkill to introduce a schema for it, because we have only one map in the game, it has very few fields, and -- which is most important -- we use the map only inside our logic, never exposing it to external users."
msgstr ""

msgid "Next, we need methods to implement the game logic. To simulate object-oriented programming in our Lua code, let's store all Lua functions and shared variables in a single local variable (let's name it as ``game``). This will allow us to address functions or variables from within our module as ``self.func_name`` or ``self.var_name``. Like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "local game = {\n"
"    -- a local variable\n"
"    num_players = 0,\n"

"    end\n"
"}"
msgstr ""

msgid "In OOP terms, we can now regard local variables inside ``game`` as object fields, and local functions as object methods."
msgstr ""

msgid "In this manual, Lua examples use **local** variables. Use **global** variables with caution, since the module’s users may be unaware of them."
msgstr ""

msgid "To enable/disable the use of undeclared global variables in your Lua code, use Tarantool's :ref:`strict <strict-module>` module."
msgstr ""

msgid "So, our game module will have the following methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``catch()`` to calculate whether the pokémon was caught (besides the coordinates of both the player and pokémon, this method will apply a probability factor, so not every pokémon within the player's reach will be caught);"
msgstr ""

msgid "``respawn()`` to add missing pokémons to the map, say, every 60 seconds (we assume that a frightened pokémon runs away, so we remove a pokémon from the map on any catch attempt and add it back to the map in a while);"
msgstr ""

msgid "``notify()`` to log information about caught pokémons (like \"Player 1 caught pokémon A\");"
msgstr ""

msgid "``start()`` to initialize the game (it will create database spaces, create and compile avro schemas, and launch ``respawn()``)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Besides, it would be convenient to have methods for working with Tarantool storage. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``add_pokemon()`` to add a pokémon to the database, and"
msgstr ""

msgid "``map()`` to populate the map with all pokémons stored in Tarantool."
msgstr ""

msgid "We'll need these two methods primarily when initializing our game, but we can also call them later, for example to test our code."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bootstrapping a database"
msgstr ""

msgid "Let's discuss game initialization. In ``start()`` method, we need to populate Tarantool spaces with pokémon data. Why not keep all game data in memory? Why use a database? The answer is: :ref:`persistence <index-box_persistence>`. Without a database, we risk losing data on power outage, for example. But if we store our data in an in-memory database, Tarantool takes care to persist it on disk whenever it's changed. This gives us one more benefit: quick startup in case of failure. Tarantool has a :ref:`smart algorithm <internals-recovery_process>` that quickly loads all data from disk into memory on startup, so the warm-up takes little time."
msgstr ""

msgid "We'll be using functions from Tarantool built-in :ref:`box <box-module>` module:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``box.schema.create_space('pokemons')`` to create a space named ``pokemon`` for storing information about pokémons (we don't create a similar space for players, because we intend to only send/receive player information via API calls, so we needn't store it);"
msgstr ""

msgid "``box.space.pokemons:create_index('primary', {type = 'hash', parts = {1, 'unsigned'}})`` to create a primary HASH index by pokémon ID;"
msgstr ""

msgid "``box.space.pokemons:create_index('status', {type = 'tree', parts = {2, 'str'}})`` to create a secondary TREE index by pokémon status."
msgstr ""

msgid "Notice the ``parts =`` argument in the index specification. The pokémon ID is the first field in a Tarantool tuple since it’s the first member of the respective Avro type. So does the pokémon status. The actual JSON document may have ID or status fields at any position of the JSON map."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "``nationalmap``, which stands for the `US National Atlas Equal Area <https://epsg.io/2163>`_. This is a projected coordinates system based on WGS84. It gives us a zero base for location projection and allows positioning our players and pokémons in meters."

But we need to execute ``respawn()`` every 60 seconds. Creating a :ref:`fiber <fiber-module>` is the Tarantool way of making application logic work in the background at all times."
msgstr ""

msgid "A **fiber** exists for executing instruction sequences but it is not a thread. The key difference is that threads use preemptive multitasking, while fibers use cooperative multitasking. This gives fibers the following two advantages over threads:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Better controllability. Threads often depend on the kernel's thread scheduler to preempt a busy thread and resume another thread, so preemption may occur unpredictably. Fibers yield themselves to run another fiber while executing, so yields are controlled by application logic."
msgstr ""

msgid "Higher performance. Threads require more resources to preempt as they need to address the system kernel. Fibers are lighter and faster as they don't need to address the kernel to yield."
msgstr ""

msgid "Yet fibers have some limitations as compared with threads, the main limitation being no multi-core mode. All fibers in an application belong to a single thread, so they all use the same CPU core as the parent thread. Meanwhile, this limitation is not really serious for Tarantool applications, because a typical bottleneck for Tarantool is the HDD, not the CPU."
msgstr ""

msgid "A fiber has all the features of a Lua `coroutine <http://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html#9>`_ and all programming concepts that apply for Lua coroutines will apply for fibers as well. However, Tarantool has made some enhancements for fibers and has used fibers internally. So, although use of coroutines is possible and supported, use of fibers is recommended."
