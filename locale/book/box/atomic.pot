msgid "Transaction control"
msgstr ""

msgid "Transactions in Tarantool occur in **fibers** on a single **thread**. That is why Tarantool has a guarantee of execution atomicity. That requires emphasis."
msgstr ""

msgid "Threads, fibers and yields"
msgstr ""

msgid "How does Tarantool process a basic operation? As an example, let's take this query:"
msgstr ""

msgid "tarantool> box.space.tester:update({3}, {{'=', 2, 'size'}, {'=', 3, 0}})"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is equivalent to the following SQL statement for a table that stores primary keys in ``field[1]``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "UPDATE tester SET \"field[2]\" = 'size', \"field[3]\" = 0 WHERE \"field[1]\" = 3"
msgstr ""

msgid "This query will be processed with three operating system **threads**:"
msgstr ""

msgid "If we issue the query on a remote client, then the **network thread** on the server side receives the query, parses the statement and changes it to a server executable message which has already been checked, and which the server instance can understand without parsing everything again."
msgstr ""

msgid "The network thread ships this message to the instance's **transaction processor thread** using a lock-free message bus. Lua programs execute directly in the transaction processor thread, and do not require parsing and preparation."
msgstr ""

msgid "The instance's transaction processor thread uses the primary-key index on field[1] to find the location of the tuple. It determines that the tuple can be updated (not much can go wrong when you're merely changing an unindexed field value to something shorter)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The transaction processor thread sends a message to the :ref:`write-ahead logging (WAL) thread <internals-wal>` to commit the transaction. When done, the WAL thread replies with a COMMIT or ROLLBACK result, which is returned to the client."
msgstr ""

msgid "Notice that there is only one transaction processor thread in Tarantool. Some people are used to the idea that there can be multiple threads operating on the database, with (say) thread #1 reading row #x, while thread #2 writes row #y. With Tarantool, no such thing ever happens. Only the transaction processor thread can access the database, and there is only one transaction processor thread for each Tarantool instance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Like any other Tarantool thread, the transaction processor thread can handle many :ref:`fibers <fiber-fibers>`. A fiber is a set of computer instructions that may contain \"**yield**\" signals. The transaction processor thread will execute all computer instructions until a yield, then switch to execute the instructions of a different fiber. Thus (say) the thread reads row #x for the sake of fiber #1, then writes row #y for the sake of fiber #2."
msgstr ""

msgid "Yields must happen, otherwise the transaction processor thread would stick permanently on the same fiber. There are two types of yields:"
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`implicit yields <atomic-implicit-yields>`: every data-change operation or network-access causes an implicit yield, and every statement that goes through the Tarantool client causes an implicit yield."
msgstr ""

msgid "explicit yields: in a Lua function, you can (and should) add :ref:`\"yield\" <fiber-yield>` statements to prevent hogging. This is called **cooperative multitasking**."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cooperative multitasking"
msgstr ""

msgid "Cooperative multitasking means: unless a running fiber deliberately yields control, it is not preempted by some other fiber. But a running fiber will deliberately yield when it encounters a “yield point”: a transaction commit, an operating system call, or an explicit :ref:`\"yield\" <fiber-yield>` request. Any system call which can block will be performed asynchronously, and any running fiber which must wait for a system call will be preempted, so that another ready-to-run fiber takes its place and becomes the new running fiber."
msgstr ""

msgid "This model makes all programmatic locks unnecessary: cooperative multitasking ensures that there will be no concurrency around a resource, no race conditions, and no memory consistency issues."
msgstr ""

msgid "When requests are small, for example simple UPDATE or INSERT or DELETE or SELECT, fiber scheduling is fair: it takes only a little time to process the request, schedule a disk write, and yield to a fiber serving the next client."
msgstr ""

msgid "However, a function might perform complex computations or might be written in such a way that yields do not occur for a long time. This can lead to unfair scheduling, when a single client throttles the rest of the system, or to apparent stalls in request processing. Avoiding this situation is the responsibility of the function’s author."
msgstr ""

msgid "Transactions"
msgstr ""

msgid "In the absence of transactions, any function that contains yield points may see changes in the database state caused by fibers that preempt. Multi-statement transactions exist to provide **isolation**: each transaction sees a consistent database state and commits all its changes atomically. At :ref:`commit <box-commit>` time, a yield happens and all transaction changes are written to the :ref:`write ahead log <internals-wal>` in a single batch. Or, if needed, transaction changes can be rolled back -- :ref:`completely <box-rollback>` or to a specific :ref:`savepoint <box-rollback_to_savepoint>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "To implement isolation, Tarantool uses a simple optimistic scheduler: the first transaction to commit wins. If a concurrent active transaction has read a value modified by a committed transaction, it is aborted."
msgstr ""

msgid "The cooperative scheduler ensures that, in absence of yields, a multi-statement transaction is not preempted and hence is never aborted. Therefore, understanding yields is essential to writing abort-free code."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sometimes while testing the transaction mechanism in Tarantool you can notice that yielding after ``box.begin()`` but before any read/write operation does not cause an abort as it should according to the description. This happens because actually ``box.begin()`` does not start a transaction. It is a mark telling Tarantool to start a transaction after some database request that follows."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can’t mix storage engines in a transaction today."
msgstr ""

msgid "Implicit yields"
msgstr ""

msgid "The only explicit yield requests in Tarantool are :ref:`fiber.sleep() <fiber-sleep>` and :ref:`fiber.yield() <fiber-yield>`, but many other requests \"imply\" yields because Tarantool is designed to avoid blocking."
msgstr ""

msgid "Database requests imply yields if and only if there is disk I/O. For memtx, since all data is in memory, there is no disk I/O during the request. For vinyl, since some data may not be in memory, there may be disk I/O for a read (to fetch data from disk) or for a write (because a stall may occur while waiting for memory to be free). For both memtx and vinyl, since data-change requests must be recorded in the WAL, there is normally a commit. A commit happens automatically after every request in default \"autocommit\" mode, or a commit happens at the end of a transaction in \"transaction\" mode, when a user deliberately commits by calling :ref:`box.commit() <box-commit>`. Therefore for both memtx and vinyl, because there can be disk I/O, some database operations may imply yields."
msgstr ""

msgid "Many functions in modules :ref:`fio <fio-section>`, :ref:`net_box <net_box-module>`, :ref:`console <console-module>` and :ref:`socket <socket-module>` (the \"os\" and \"network\" requests) yield."
msgstr ""

msgid "That is why executing separate commands such as ``select()``, ``insert()``, ``update()`` in the console inside a transaction will cause an abort. This is due to implicit yield happening after each chunk of code is executed in the console."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Example #1**"
msgstr ""

msgid "*Engine = memtx* |br| ``select() insert()`` has one yield, at the end of insertion, caused by implicit commit; ``select()`` has nothing to write to the WAL and so does not yield."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Engine = vinyl* |br| ``select() insert()`` has between one and three yields, since ``select()`` may yield if the data is not in cache, ``insert()`` may yield waiting for available memory, and there is an implicit yield at commit."
msgstr ""

msgid "The sequence ``begin() insert() insert() commit()`` yields only at commit if the engine is memtx, and can yield up to 3 times if the engine is vinyl."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Example #2**"
msgstr ""

msgid "Assume that in space ‘tester’ there are tuples in which the third field represents a positive dollar amount. Let's start a transaction, withdraw from tuple#1, deposit in tuple#2, and end the transaction, making its effects permanent."
msgstr ""

msgid "tarantool> function txn_example(from, to, amount_of_money)\n"
"         >   box.begin()\n"
"         >   box.space.tester:update(from, {{'-', 3, amount_of_money}})\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "If :ref:`wal_mode <cfg_binary_logging_snapshots-wal_mode>` = ‘none’, then implicit yielding at commit time does not take place, because there are no writes to the WAL."
msgstr ""

msgid "If a task is interactive -- sending requests to the server and receiving responses -- then it involves network IO, and therefore there is an implicit yield, even if the request that is sent to the server is not itself an implicit yield request. Therefore, the sequence:"
msgstr ""

msgid "select\n"

msgid "causes blocking (in memtx), if it is inside a function or Lua program being executed on the server instance, but causes yielding (in both memtx and vinyl) if it is done as a series of transmissions from a client, including a client which operates via telnet, via one of the connectors, or via the :ref:`MySQL and PostgreSQL rocks <dbms_modules>`, or via the interactive mode when :ref:`using Tarantool as a client <admin-using_tarantool_as_a_client>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "After a fiber has yielded and then has regained control, it immediately issues :ref:`testcancel <fiber-testcancel>`."
