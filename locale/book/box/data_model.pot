msgid "Data model"
msgstr ""

msgid "This section describes how Tarantool stores values and what operations with data it supports."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you tried to create a database as suggested in our :ref:`\"Getting started\" exercises <getting_started>`, then your test database now looks like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Space"
msgstr ""

msgid "A **space** -- 'tester' in our example -- is a container."
msgstr ""

msgid "When Tarantool is being used to store data, there is always at least one space. Each space has a unique **name** specified by the user. Besides, each space has a unique **numeric identifier** which can be specified by the user, but usually is assigned automatically by Tarantool. Finally, a space always has an **engine**: *memtx* (default) -- in-memory engine, fast but limited in size, or *vinyl* -- on-disk engine for huge data sets."
msgstr ""

msgid "A space is a container for :ref:`tuples <index-box_tuple>`. To be functional, it needs to have a :ref:`primary index <index-box_index>`. It can also have secondary indexes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tuple"
msgstr ""

msgid "A **tuple** plays the same role as a “row” or a “record”, and the components of a tuple (which we call “fields”) play the same role as a “row column” or “record field”, except that:"
msgstr ""

msgid "fields can be composite structures, such as arrays or maps, and"
msgstr ""

msgid "fields don't need to have names."
msgstr ""

msgid "Any given tuple may have any number of fields, and the fields may be of different :ref:`types <index-box_data-types>`. The identifier of a field is the field's number, base 1 (in Lua and other 1-based languages) or base 0 (in PHP or C/C++). For example, ``1`` or ``0`` can be used in some contexts to refer to the first field of a tuple."
msgstr ""

msgid "The number of tuples in a space is unlimited."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tuples in Tarantool are stored as `MsgPack <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MessagePack>`_ arrays."
msgstr ""

msgid "When Tarantool returns a tuple value in the console, by default it uses :ref:`YAML <interactive_console>` format, for example: ``[3, 'Ace of Base', 1993]``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Index"
msgstr ""

msgid "An **index** is a group of key values and pointers."
msgstr ""

msgid "As with spaces, you should specify the index **name**, and let Tarantool come up with a unique **numeric identifier** (\"index id\")."
msgstr ""

msgid "An index always has a **type**. The default index type is 'TREE'. TREE indexes are provided by all Tarantool engines, can index unique and non-unique values, support partial key searches, comparisons and ordered results. Additionally, memtx engine supports HASH, RTREE and BITSET indexes."
msgstr ""

msgid "An index may be **multi-part**, that is, you can declare that an index key value is composed of two or more fields in the tuple, in any order. For example, for an ordinary TREE index, the maximum number of parts is 255."
msgstr ""

msgid "An index may be **unique**, that is, you can declare that it would be illegal to have the same key value twice."
msgstr ""

msgid "The first index defined on a space is called the **primary key index**, and it must be unique. All other indexes are called **secondary indexes**, and they may be non-unique."
msgstr ""

msgid "An index definition may include identifiers of tuple fields and their expected **types** (see allowed :ref:`indexed field types <index-box_indexed-field-types>` below)."
msgstr ""

msgid "A recommended design pattern for a data model is to base primary keys on the first fields of a tuple, because this speeds up tuple comparison."
msgstr ""

msgid "In our example, we first defined the primary index (named 'primary') based on field #1 of each tuple:"
msgstr ""

msgid "tarantool> i = s:create_index('primary', {type = 'hash', parts = {{field = 1, type = 'unsigned'}}}"
msgstr ""

msgid "The effect is that, for all tuples in space 'tester', field #1 must exist and must contain an unsigned integer. The index type is 'hash', so values in field #1 must be unique, because keys in HASH indexes are unique."
msgstr ""

msgid "After that, we defined a secondary index (named 'secondary') based on field #2 of each tuple:"
msgstr ""

msgid "tarantool> i = s:create_index('secondary', {type = 'tree', parts = {field = 2, type = 'string'}})"
msgstr ""

msgid "The effect is that, for all tuples in space 'tester', field #2 must exist and must contain a string. The index type is 'tree', so values in field #2 must not be unique, because keys in TREE indexes may be non-unique."
msgstr ""

msgid "Space definitions and index definitions are stored permanently in Tarantool's system spaces :ref:`_space <box_space-space>` and :ref:`_index <box_space-index>` (for details, see reference on :ref:`box.space <box_space>` submodule)."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can add, drop, or alter the definitions at runtime, with some restrictions. See syntax details in reference on :ref:`box <box-module>` module."
msgstr ""

msgid "Data types"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tarantool is both a database and an application server. Hence a developer often deals with two type sets: the programming language types (e.g. Lua) and the types of the Tarantool storage format (MsgPack)."

msgid "In Lua, a **nil** type has only one possible value, also called *nil* (displayed as **null** on Tarantool's command line, since the output is in the YAML format). Nils may be compared to values of any types with == (is-equal) or ~= (is-not-equal), but other operations will not work. Nils may not be used in Lua tables; the workaround is to use :ref:`msgpack.NULL <msgpack-null>`"
msgstr ""

msgid "A **boolean** is either ``true`` or ``false``."
msgstr ""

msgid "A **string** is a variable-length sequence of bytes, usually represented with alphanumeric characters inside single quotes. In both Lua and MsgPack, strings are treated as binary data, with no attempts to determine a string's character set or to perform any string conversion -- unless there is an optional :ref:`collation <index-collation>`. So, usually, string sorting and comparison are done byte-by-byte, without any special collation rules applied. (Example: numbers are ordered by their point on the number line, so 2345 is greater than 500; meanwhile, strings are ordered by the encoding of the first byte, then the encoding of the second byte, and so on, so '2345' is less than '500'.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "In Lua, a **number** is double-precision floating-point, but Tarantool allows both integer and floating-point values. Tarantool will try to store a Lua number as floating-point if the value contains a decimal point or is very large (greater than 100 trillion = 1e14), otherwise Tarantool will store it as an integer. To ensure that even very large numbers are stored as integers, use the :ref:`tonumber64 <other-tonumber64>` function, or the LL (Long Long) suffix, or the ULL (Unsigned Long Long) suffix. Here are examples of numbers using regular notation, exponential notation, the ULL suffix and the ``tonumber64`` function: ``-55``, ``-2.7e+20``, ``100000000000000ULL``, ``tonumber64('18446744073709551615')``."
msgstr ""

msgid "A **bin** (binary) value is not directly supported by Lua but there is a Tarantool type ``VARBINARY`` which is encoded as MessagePack binary. For an (advanced) example showing how to insert VARBINARY into a database, see the Cookbook Recipe for :ref:`ffi_varbinary_insert <cookbook-ffi_varbinary_insert>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Lua **tables** with string keys are stored as MsgPack maps; Lua tables with integer keys starting with 1 -- as MsgPack arrays. Nils may not be used in Lua tables; the workaround is to use :ref:`msgpack.NULL <msgpack-null>`"
msgstr ""

msgid "A **tuple** is a light reference to a MsgPack array stored in the database. It is a special type (cdata) to avoid conversion to a Lua table on retrieval. A few functions may return tables with multiple tuples. For more tuple examples, see :ref:`box.tuple <box_tuple>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tarantool uses the MsgPack format for database storage, which is variable-length. So, for example, the smallest number requires only one byte, but the largest number requires nine bytes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Examples of insert requests with different data types:"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Indexed field types"
msgstr ""

msgid "Indexes restrict values which Tarantool's MsgPack may contain. This is why, for example, 'unsigned' is a separate **indexed field type**, compared to ‘integer’ data type in MsgPack: they both store ‘integer’ values, but an 'unsigned' index contains only *non-negative* integer values and an ‘integer’ index contains *all* integer values."

msgid "By default, when Tarantool compares strings, it uses what we call a **\"binary\" collation**. The only consideration here is the numeric value of each byte in the string. Therefore, if the string is encoded with ASCII or UTF-8, then ``'A' < 'B' < 'a'``, because the encoding of 'A' (what used to be called the \"ASCII value\") is 65, the encoding of 'B' is 66, and the encoding of 'a' is 98. Binary collation is best if you prefer fast deterministic simple maintenance and searching with Tarantool indexes."
msgstr ""

msgid "But if you want the ordering that you see in phone books and dictionaries, then you need Tarantool's optional collations, such as ``unicode`` and ``unicode_ci``, which allow for ``'a' < 'A' < 'B'`` and ``'a' = 'A' < 'B'`` respectively."
msgstr ""

msgid "**The unicode and unicode_ci optional collations** use the ordering according to the `Default Unicode Collation Element Table (DUCET) <http://unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Default_Unicode_Collation_Element_Table>`_ and the rules described in `Unicode® Technical Standard #10 Unicode Collation Algorithm (UTS #10 UCA) <http://unicode.org/reports/tr10>`_.

The tailored collation names have the form unicode_[language code]_[strength] where language code is a standard 2-character or 3-character language abbreviation, and strength is s1 for \"primary strength\" (level-1 weights), s2 for \"secondary\", s3 for \"tertiary\". Tarantool uses the same language codes as the ones in the \"list of tailorable locales\" on man pages of `Ubuntu <http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man3/Unicode::Collate::Locale.3perl.html>`_ and `Fedora <http://www.polarhome.com/service/man/?qf=Unicode%3A%3ACollate%3A%3ALocale&af=0&tf=2&of=Fedora>`_.

When a power outage occurs or the Tarantool instance is killed incidentally, the in-memory database is lost. In this situation, WAL files are used to restore the data. Namely, Tarantool reads the WAL files and redoes the requests (this is called the \"recovery process\"). You can change the timing of the WAL writer, or turn it off, by setting :ref:`wal_mode <cfg_binary_logging_snapshots-wal_mode>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tarantool also maintains a set of :ref:`snapshot files <internals-snapshot>`. These files contain an on-disk copy of the entire data set for a given moment. Instead of reading every WAL file since the databases were created, the recovery process can load the latest snapshot file and then read only those WAL files that were produced after the snapshot file was made. After checkpointing, old WAL files can be removed to free up space."
msgstr ""

msgid "To force immediate creation of a snapshot file, you can use Tarantool's :ref:`box.snapshot() <box-snapshot>` request. To enable automatic creation of snapshot files, you can use Tarantool's :ref:`checkpoint daemon <book_cfg_checkpoint_daemon>`. The checkpoint daemon sets intervals for forced checkpoints. It makes sure that the states of both memtx and vinyl storage engines are synchronized and saved to disk, and automatically removes old WAL files."

msgid ":ref:`UPSERT <box_space-upsert>`: Upsert the tuple, changing field field[2] again."
msgstr ""

msgid "The syntax of ``upsert()`` is similar to the syntax of ``update()``. However, the execution logic of these two requests is different. UPSERT is either UPDATE or INSERT, depending on the database's state. Also, UPSERT execution is postponed until after transaction commit, so, unlike ``update()``, ``upsert()`` doesn't return data back."
