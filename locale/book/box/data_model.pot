msgid "A **space** -- 'tester' in our example -- is a container."
msgstr ""

msgid "When Tarantool is being used to store data, there is always at least one space. Each space has a unique **name** specified by the user. Besides, each space has a unique **numeric identifier** which can be specified by the user, but usually is assigned automatically by Tarantool. Finally, a space always has an **engine**: *memtx* (default) -- in-memory engine, fast but limited in size, or *vinyl* -- on-disk engine for huge data sets."
msgstr ""

msgid "A space is a container for :ref:`tuples <index-box_tuple>`. To be functional, it needs to have a :ref:`primary index <index-box_index>`. It can also have secondary indexes."

msgid "Tuple"

msgid "A **tuple** plays the same role as a “row” or a “record”, and the components of a tuple (which we call “fields”) play the same role as a “row column” or “record field”, except that:"
msgstr ""

msgid "fields can be composite structures, such as arrays or maps, and"
msgstr ""

msgid "fields don't need to have names."
msgstr ""

msgid "Any given tuple may have any number of fields, and the fields may be of different :ref:`types <index-box_data-types>`. The identifier of a field is the field's number, base 1 (in Lua and other 1-based languages) or base 0 (in PHP or C/C++). For example, ``1`` or ``0`` can be used in some contexts to refer to the first field of a tuple."
msgstr ""

msgid "The number of tuples in a space is unlimited."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tuples in Tarantool are stored as `MsgPack <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MessagePack>`_ arrays."

msgid "Index"

msgid "An **index** is a group of key values and pointers."

So, usually, string sorting and comparison are done byte-by-byte, without any special collation rules applied. (Example: numbers are ordered by their point on the number line, so 2345 is greater than 500; meanwhile, strings are ordered by the encoding of the first byte, then the encoding of the second byte, and so on, so '2345' is less than '500'.)"

To ensure that even very large numbers are stored as integers, use the :ref:`tonumber64 <other-tonumber64>` function, or the LL (Long Long) suffix, or the ULL (Unsigned Long Long) suffix.
