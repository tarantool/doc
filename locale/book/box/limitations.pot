msgid "**Number of parts in an index**"
msgstr ""

msgid "For TREE or HASH indexes, the maximum is 255 (``box.schema.INDEX_PART_MAX``). For :ref:`RTREE <box_index-rtree>` indexes, the maximum is 1 but the field is an ARRAY of up to 20 dimensions. For BITSET indexes, the maximum is 1."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Number of indexes in a space**"
msgstr ""

msgid "128 (``box.schema.INDEX_MAX``)."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Number of fields in a tuple**"
msgstr ""

msgid "The theoretical maximum is 2,147,483,647 (``box.schema.FIELD_MAX``). The practical maximum is whatever is specified by the space's :ref:`field_count <box_space-field_count>` member, or the maximal tuple length."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Number of bytes in a tuple**"
msgstr ""

msgid "The maximal number of bytes in a tuple is roughly equal to :ref:`memtx_max_tuple_size <cfg_storage-memtx_max_tuple_size>` or :ref:`vinyl_max_tuple_size <cfg_storage-vinyl_max_tuple_size>` (with a metadata overhead of about 20 bytes per tuple, which is added on top of useful bytes). By default, the value of either ``memtx_max_tuple_size`` or ``vinyl_max_tuple_size`` is 1,048,576. To increase it, specify a larger value when starting the Tarantool instance. For example, ``box.cfg{memtx_max_tuple_size=2*1048576}``."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Number of bytes in an index key**"
msgstr ""

msgid "If a field in a tuple can contain a million bytes, then the index key can contain a million bytes, so the maximum is determined by factors such as :ref:`Number of bytes in a tuple <limitations_bytes_in_tuple>`, not by the index support."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Number of spaces**"
msgstr ""

msgid "The theoretical maximum is 2147483647 (``box.schema.SPACE_MAX``) but the practical maximum is around 65,000."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Number of connections**"
msgstr ""

msgid "The practical limit is the number of file descriptors that one can set with the operating system."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Space size**"
msgstr ""

msgid "The total maximum size for all spaces is in effect set by :ref:`memtx_memory <cfg_storage-memtx_memory>`, which in turn is limited by the total available memory."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Update operations count**"
msgstr ""

msgid "The maximum number of operations per tuple that can be in a single update is 4000 (``BOX_UPDATE_OP_CNT_MAX``)."

msgid "**Number of users and roles**"

msgid "32 (``BOX_USER_MAX``)."
