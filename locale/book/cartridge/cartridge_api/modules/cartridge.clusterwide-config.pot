msgstr ""

msgid "The abstraction, representing clusterwide configuration."
msgstr ""

msgid "Clusterwide configuration is more than just a lua table. It's an object in terms of OOP paradigm."
msgstr ""

msgid "On filesystem clusterwide config is represented by a file tree."
msgstr ""

msgid "In Lua it's represented as an object which holds both plaintext files content and unmarshalled lua tables. Unmarshalling is implicit and performed automatically for the sections with  ``.yml``  file extension."
msgstr ""

msgid "To access plaintext content there are two functions: `get_plaintext` and  ``set_plaintext`` ."
msgstr ""

msgid "Unmarshalled lua tables are accessed without  ``.yml``  extension by ``get_readonly``  and  ``get_deepcopy`` . Plaintext serves for accessing unmarshalled representation of corresponding sections."
msgstr ""

msgid "To avoid ambiguity it's prohibited to keep both `<FILENAME>` and `<FILENAME>.yml` in the configuration. An attempt to do so would result in `return nil, err` from `new()` and `load()`, and an attempt to call  ``get_readonly/deepcopy``  would raise an error. Nevertheless one can keep any other extensions because they aren't unmarshalled implicitly."
