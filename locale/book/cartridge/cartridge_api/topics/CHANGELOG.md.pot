msgstr ""

msgid "**(incompatible change)**"
msgstr ""

msgid "Base advertise port in luatest helpers changed from 33000 to 13300, which is outside `ip_local_port_range`. Using port from local range usually caused tests failing with an error \"address already in use\". (*incompatible change*, but affects tests only)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Whole new way to bootstrap instances. Instead of polling membership for getting clusterwide config the instance now start Remote Control Server (with limited iproto protocol functionality) on the same port. Two-phase commit is then executed over net.box connection. (**major change**, but still compatible)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Failover isn't triggered on `suspect` instance state anymore"

msgstr ""

msgid "Clusterwide configuration is now represented with a file tree. All sections that were tables are saved to separate `.yml` files. Compatibility with the old-style configuration is preserved. Accessing unmarshalled sections with `get_readonly/deepcopy` methods is provided without `.yml` extension as earlier. (**major change**, but still compatible)"
msgstr ""

msgid "After an old leader restarts it'll try to sync with an active one before taking the leadership again so that failover doesn't switch too early before leader finishes recovery. If replication setup fails the instance enters the `OperationError` state, which can be avoided by explicitly specifying `replication_connect_quorum = 1` (or 0)."
msgstr ""

msgid "**(major change)**"
msgstr ""

msgid "Option `{prefer_local = false}` in `rpc_call` makes it always use netbox connection, even to connect self. It never tries to perform call locally."
msgstr ""

msgid "Update `vshard` dependency to 0.1.14."
msgstr ""

msgid "Removed"
msgstr ""

msgid "Function `cartridge.bootstrap` is removed. Use `admin_edit_topology` interad. **(incompatible change)**"
msgstr ""

msgid "Misspelled role callback `validate` is now removed completely. Keep using `validate_config`."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Race condition when creating working directory."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Allow specifying vshard storage group in test helpers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Get UI components from Tarantool UI-Kit"

msgid "When recovering from snapshot, instances are started read-only. It is still possible to override it by argparse (command line arguments or environment variables)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Editing topology with `failover_priority` argument."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Catch `rpc_call` errors when they are performed locally"
msgstr ""

msgid "[1.1.0] - 2019-09-24"
msgstr ""

msgid "New Lua API `admin_edit_topology` has been added to unite multiple others: `admin_edit_replicaset`, `admin_edit_server`, `admin_join_server`, `admin_expel_server`. It's suitable for editing multiple servers/replicasets at once. It can be used for bootstrapping cluster from scratch, joining a server to an existing replicaset, creating new replicaset with one or more servers, editing uri/labels of servers, disabling or expelling servers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Similar API is implemented in a GraphQL mutation `cluster{edit_topology()}`."
msgstr ""

msgid "New GraphQL mutation `cluster { edit_vshard_options }` is suitable for fine-tuning vshard options: `rebalancer_max_receiving`, `collect_lua_garbage`, `sync_timeout`, `collect_bucket_garbage_interval`, `rebalancer_disbalance_threshold`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Both bootstrapping from scratch and patching topology in clusterwide config automatically probe servers, which aren't added to membership yet (earlier it influenced join_server mutation only). This is a prerequisite for multijoin api implementation."
msgstr ""

msgid "WebUI users page is hidden if auth_backend doesn't provide list_users callback."
msgstr ""

msgid "`cartridge.admin_edit_replicaset()`"

msgstr ""

msgid "Protect `users_acl` and `auth` sections when downloading clusterwide config. Also forbid uploading them."
msgstr ""

msgid "[1.0.0] - 2019-08-29"
msgstr ""

msgid "New parameter `topology.replicasets[].all_rw` in clusterwide config for configuring all instances in the replicaset as `read_only = false`. It can be managed with both GraphQL and Lua API `edit_replicaset`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Remote Control server - a replacement for the `box.cfg({listen})`, with limited functionality, independent on `box.cfg`. The server is only to be used internally for bootstrapping new instances."
msgstr ""

msgid "New module `argparse` for gathering configuration options from command-line arguments, environment variables, and configuration files. It is used internally and overrides `cluster.cfg` and `box.cfg` options."
msgstr ""

msgid "Auth parameter `cookie_max_age` is now configurable with GraphQL API. Also now it's stored in clusterwide config, so changing it on a single server will affect all others in cluster."
msgstr ""

msgid "Detect that we run under systemd and switch to syslog logging from stderr. This allows to filter log messages by severity with `journalctl`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Redesign WebUI"
msgstr ""

msgid "The project renamed to **cartridge**. Use `require('cartridge')` instead of `require('cluster')`. All submodules are renamed too."
msgstr ""

msgid "Submodule `cluster.test_helpers` renamed to `cartridge.test-helpers` for consistency."
msgstr ""

msgid "Modifying auth params with GraphQL before the cluster was bootstrapped is now forbidden and returns an error."
msgstr ""

msgid "Introducing a new auth parameter `cookie_renew_age`. When cluster handles an HTTP request with the cookie, whose age in older then specified, it refreshes the cookie. It may be useful to set `cookie_max_age` to a small value (for example 10 minutes), so the user will be logged out after `cookie_max_age` seconds of inactivity. Otherwise, if he's active, the cookie will be updated every `cookie_renew_age` seconds and the session will not be interrupted."
msgstr ""

msgid "Changed configuration options for `cluster.cfg()`: `roles` now is a mandatory table, `workdir` is optional now (defaults to \".\")"
msgstr ""

msgid "Parameter `advertise_uri` is optional now, default value is derived as follows. `advertise_uri` is a compound of `<HOST>` and `<PORT>`. When `<HOST>` isn't specified, it's detected as the only non-local IP address. If it can't be determined or there is more than one IP address available it defaults to `\"localhost\"`. When `<PORT>` isn't specified, it's derived from numeric suffix `_<N>` of `TARANTOOL_INSTANCE_NAME`: `<PORT> = 3300+<N>`. Otherwise default `<PORT> = 3301` is used."
msgstr ""

msgid "Parameter `http_port` is derived from instance name too. If it can't be derived it defaults to 8081. New parameter `http_enabled = false` is used to disable it (by default it's enabled)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Removed user `cluster`, which was used internally for orchestration over netbox. Tarantool built-in user `admin` is used instead now. It can also be used for HTTP authentication to access WebUI. Cluster cookie is used as a password in both cases."
msgstr ""

msgid "Two-layer table structure in API, which was deprecated earlier, is now removed completely:"
msgstr ""

msgid "`cartridge.service_registry.*`"
msgstr ""

msgid "`cartridge.confapplier.*`"

msgid "[0.10.0] - 2019-08-01"
msgstr ""

msgid "Cluster can now operate without vshard roles (if you don't need sharding). Deprecation warning about implicit vshard roles isn't issued any more, they aren't registered unless explicitly specified either in `cluster.cfg({roles=...})` or in `dependencies` to one of user-defined roles."
msgstr ""

msgid "New role flag `hidden = true`. Hidden roles aren't listed in `cluster.admin.get_replicasets().roles` and therefore in WebUI. Hidden roles are supposed to be a dependency for another role, yet they still can be enabled with `edit_replicaset` function (both Lua and GraphQL)."
msgstr ""

msgid "New role flag: `permanent = true`. Permanent roles are always enabled. Also they are hidden implicitly."
msgstr ""

msgid "New functions in cluster test_helpers - `Cluster:upload_config(config)` and `Cluster:download_config()`"
msgstr ""

msgid "`cluster.call_rpc` used to return 'Role unavailable' error as a first argument instead of `nil, err`. It can appear when role is specified in clusterwide config, but wasn't initialized properly. There are two reasons for that: race condition, or prior error in either role `init` or `apply_config` methods."
