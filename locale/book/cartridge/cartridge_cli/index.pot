msgid "To build your application locally (for local testing), say this in any directory:"

msgid "cartridge build [<path>]"
msgstr ""

msgid "This command requires one argument -- the path to your application directory (i.e. to the build source). The default path is `.` (the current directory)."

msgid "This command runs:"

msgstr ""

msgid "During step 2 -- the key step here -- `cartridge` installs all dependencies specified in the rockspec file (you can find this file within the application directory created from template)."
msgstr ""

msgid "**NOTE:** An advanced alternative would be to specify build logic in the rockspec as `cmake` commands, like we `do it <https://github.com/tarantool/cartridge/blob/master/cartridge-scm-1.rockspec#L26>`_. for `cartridge`."
msgstr ""

msgid "If your application depends on closed-source rocks, or if the build should contain rocks from a project added as a submodule, then you need to **install** all these dependencies before calling `tarantoolctl rocks make`. You can do it using the file `cartridge.pre-build` in your application root (again, you can find this file within the application directory created from template). In this file, you can specify all rocks to build (e.g. `tarantoolctl rocks make --chdir ./third_party/proj`). For details, see :ref:`special files <special-files>`."

msgid "As a result, in the application's `.rocks` directory you will get a fully built application that you can start locally from the application's directory."
msgstr ""

msgid "Building in Docker"
msgstr ""

msgid "By default, `cartridge build` is building an application locally."
msgstr ""

msgid "However, if you build it in OS X, all rocks and executables in the resulting package will be specific for OS X, so the application won't work in Linux. To build an application in OS X and run it in Linux, call `cartridge build` with the flag `--use-docker` and get the application built in a Docker container."

msgid "`--run-dir DIR` is the directory with pid and sock files. Defaults to TARANTOOL_RUN_DIR or `/var/run/tarantool`."
msgstr ""

msgid "`--cfg FILE` is the configuration file for Cartridge instances. Defaults to TARANTOOL_CFG or `./instances.yml`."
msgstr ""

msgid "`--daemonize / -d` starts the instance in background. With this option, Tarantool also waits until the app's main script is finished. For example, this is useful if `init.lua` requires time-consuming startup from snapshot, and Tarantool waits for the startup to complete. This is also useful if the app's main script generates errors, and Tarantool can handle them."

msgstr ""

msgid "**NOTE:** Yet another supported option is `rock`, but it's not production-ready yet."
msgstr ""

msgid "`path` [OPTIONAL] is the path to the application directory to pack. Defaults to `.` (the current directory)."
msgstr ""

msgid "`--name`(common for all distribution types) is the application name. It coincides with the package name and the systemd-service name. The default name comes from the `package` field in the rockspec file."
msgstr ""

msgid "`--version` (common for all distribution types) is the application's package version. The expected pattern is `major.minor.patch[-count][-commit]`: if you specify `major.minor.patch`, it is normalized to `major.minor.patch-count`. The default version is determined as the result of `git describe --tags --long`. If the application is not a git repository, you need to set the `--version` option explicitly."
msgstr ""

msgid "`--unit-template` (used for `rpm` и `deb`) is the path to the template for the `systemd` unit file."
msgstr ""

msgid "`--instantiated-unit-template` (used for `rpm` и `deb`) is the path to the template for the `systemd` instantiated unit file."
msgstr ""

msgid "`--from` (used for `docker`) is the path to the base Dockerfile of the runtime image. Defaults to `Dockerfile.cartridge` in the application root."
msgstr ""

msgid "`--use-docker` (ignored for `docker`) forces to build the application in Docker."
msgstr ""

msgid "`--download-token` (common for all distribution types) is the download token for Tarantool Enterprise. Alternatively, you can pass the token via the `TARANTOOL_DOWNLOAD_TOKEN` environment variable (this variable is of lower priority)."
msgstr ""

msgid "`--tag` (used for `docker`) is the tag of the Docker image that results from `pack docker`."
msgstr ""

msgid "`--build-from` (used for `docker`) is the path to the base Dockerfile of the build image. Defaults to `Dockerfile.build.cartridge` in the application root."
msgstr ""

msgid "`--sdk-local` (used for `docker`) is a flag that indicates if the SDK from the local machine should be installed to the image."
msgstr ""

msgid "`--sdk-path` (used for `docker`) is the path to the SDK to be installed to the image. Alternatively, you can pass the path via the `TARANTOOL_SDK_PATH` environment variable (this variable is of lower priority)."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Note:** For Tarantool Enterprise, you must specify one (and only one) of the `--sdk-local` and `--sdk-path` options."
msgstr ""

msgid "For `rpm`, `deb`, and `tgz`, we also deliver rocks modules and executables specific for the system where the `cartridge pack` command is running."
msgstr ""

msgid "For `docker`, the resulting runtime image will contain rocks modules and executables specific for the base image (`centos:8`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The result will be named as `<name>-<version>.<type>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Further on we dive deeper into the packaging process."
msgstr ""

msgid "Build directory"
msgstr ""

msgid "The first step of the packaging process is to :ref:`build the application <building-an-application>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "By default, application build is done in a temporary directory in `~/.cartridge/tmp/`, so the packaging process doesn't affect the contents of your application directory."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can specify a custom build directory for your application in the `CARTRIDGE_BUILDDIR` environment variable. If this directory doesn't exists, it will be created, used for building the application, and then removed."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you specify an existing directory in the `CARTRIDGE_BUILDDIR` environment variable, the `CARTRIDGE_BUILDDIR/build.cartridge` repository will be used for build and then removed. This directory will be cleaned up before building the application."
msgstr ""

msgid "**NOTE:** The specified directory cannot be an application subdirectory."
msgstr ""

msgid "Distribution directory"
msgstr ""

msgid "For each distribution type, a temporary directory with application source files is created (further on we address it as *application directory*). This includes 3 stages."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stage 1. Cleaning up the application directory"
msgstr ""

msgid "On this stage, some files are filtered out of the application directory:"
msgstr ""

msgid "First, `git clean -X -d -f` removes all untracked and ignored files (it works for submodules, too)."
msgstr ""

msgid "After that, `.rocks` and `.git` directories are removed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Files permissions are preserved, and the code files owner is set to `root:root` in the resulting package."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Note**: All application files should have at least `a+r` permissions (`a+rx` for directories). Otherwise, `cartridge pack` command raises an error."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stage 2. Building the application"
msgstr ""

msgid "On this stage, `cartridge` :ref:`builds <building-an-application>` the application in the cleaned up application directory."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stage 3. Cleaning up the files before packing"
msgstr ""

msgid "On this stage, `cartridge` runs `cartridge.post-build` (if it exists) to remove junk files (like `node_modules`) generated during application build."

For example, if you start an instance with an advertise URI set to `localhost:3302`, and then address it as `<instance-host>:3302` from other instances, this won't work: the other instances will be recognizing it only as `localhost:3302`."
