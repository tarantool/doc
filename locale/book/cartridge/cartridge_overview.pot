msgid "About Tarantool Cartridge"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tarantool Cartridge is the recommended alternative to the :ref:`old-school practices <app_server-creating_app>` of application development for Tarantool."
msgstr ""

msgid "As a software development kit (SDK), Tarantool Cartridge provides you with utilities and :ref:`templates <cartridge-templates>` to help:"
msgstr ""

msgid "easily set up a development environment for your applications;"
msgstr ""

msgid "plug the necessary Lua modules."
msgstr ""

msgid "The resulting package can be installed and started on one or multiple servers as one or multiple instantiated services -- independent or organized into a **cluster**."
msgstr ""

msgid "A Tarantool cluster is a collection of Tarantool instances acting in concert. While a single Tarantool instance can leverage the performance of a single server and is vulnerable to failure, the cluster spans multiple servers, utilizes their cumulative CPU power, and is fault-tolerant."
msgstr ""

msgid "To fully utilize the capabilities of a Tarantool cluster, you need to develop applications keeping in mind they are to run in a cluster environment."
msgstr ""

msgid "Further on, Tarantool Cartridge provides your cluster-aware applications with the following benefits:"
msgstr ""

msgid "horizontal scalability and load balancing via built-in automatic sharding;"
msgstr ""

msgid "asynchronous replication;"
msgstr ""

msgid "automatic failover;"
msgstr ""

msgid "centralized cluster control via GUI or API;"
msgstr ""

msgid "automatic configuration synchronization;"
msgstr ""

msgid "instance functionality segregation."
msgstr ""

msgid "A Tarantool Cartridge cluster can segregate functionality between instances via built-in and custom (user-defined) :ref:`cluster roles <cartridge-roles>`. You can toggle instances on and off on the fly during cluster operation. This allows you to put different types of workloads (e.g., compute- and transaction-intensive ones) on different physical servers with dedicated hardware."
