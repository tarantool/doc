msgstr ""

msgid "We have a `special Telegram chat <https://t.me/tarantool_contrib>`_ for contributors. We speak Russian and English in the chat."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is the easiest way to get your questions answered. Many people are afraid to ask questions because they think they are \"wasting the experts' time,\" but no one really thinks so. Contributors are important to us."

All you need to do is fill in one product comment field and send it to us. If you don't mind -- leave your email address. If you wish, we can involve you in the product development process."
msgstr ""

msgid "**A more technical way** is to create a ticket on GitHub. If you have a suggestion for a new feature or information about a bug, `follow the link <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/new>`_ and leave a ticket. The link leads to the ``tarantool/tarantool`` repository. For any other projects on GitHub select \"Issues\" - \"New issue\"."

msgstr ""

msgid "We divide the Tarantool ecosystem into 4 types:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tarantool itself."
msgstr ""

msgid "Modules for Tarantool. They can be written in C and Lua."
msgstr ""

msgid "Connectors for programming languages."
msgstr ""

msgid "Applied tools. See a selection including external tools in the `\"awesome Tarantool\" list <https://github.com/tarantool/awesome-tarantool>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "First-time tasks can be easily found in the issues section of any repository by the \"good first issue\" tag. These are beginner to intermediate tasks that will help you get comfortable with the tool."
msgstr ""

msgid "See the `list of tasks <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/labels/good%20first%20issue>`_ for the ``tarantool/tarantool`` repository."
msgstr ""

msgid "For each repository we have a queue for reviewing, and reviewing your changes can be delayed. We try to give the first answer within two days. Depending on the ticket and its complexity, the review time may take a week or more."
msgstr ""

msgid "Please do not hesitate to tag the maintainer in your GitHub ticket."
msgstr ""

msgid "Read further about the contribution to each of the blocks."
msgstr ""

msgid "You have a problem in documentation. How to tell about it and how to fix it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "There are several ways to improve the documentation:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**The easiest one** is to leave your comment on the web documentation page. All you need to do is click on the red button in the bottom right corner of the page and fill in the comment field. You can point out an error, provide feedback on the current article, or suggest changes. We review each comment and take it to work. This form is built into the documentation on the Tarantool website."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Advanced** -- All Tarantool documentation tasks are `in the repository <https://github.com/tarantool/doc/issues>`_. Here you can take any tasks and suggest your changes. Our documentation is written in the `ReST format <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`_. :ref:`Here <documentation_guidelines>` is our Style Guide for writers. After making the change, you need to build the documentation locally and see how it was laid out. This is done automatically in Docker. `Read more in the README of the tarantool/doc repository. <https://github.com/tarantool/doc>`_"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some projects have their documentation in the code repository. For example, `Tarantool Cartridge <https://github.com/tarantool/cartridge/>`_. This is done on purpose, so the developers themselves can update it faster. Instructions for building such documentation sets are in the code repository."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you find that the documentation in the README of a module or, for example, a connector is incomplete or wrong, the best way to influence this is to fix it yourself. Clone the repository, fix the bug, and suggest changes as a PR (pull request). It will take you 5 minutes and will help the whole community."
msgstr ""

msgid "If for some reason you cannot fix it, create a ticket in this repository and report the error. Such errors are fixed quickly."

msgid "A patch can be offered in two ways:"
msgstr ""

msgid "(preferred) Using a fork and pull mechanism on GitHub: make changes to your copy of the repository and submit to us for review. See details `here <https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork>`_."

msgid "How to contribute to language connectors"
msgstr ""

msgid "A connector is a library that provides an API for accessing Tarantool from a programming language. Tarantool uses its own binary protocol for access, and the connector's task is to transfer user requests to the database and application server in the required format."
msgstr ""

msgid "Data access connectors have already been implemented for all major languages. If you want to write your own connector, you first need to familiarize yourself with the Tarantool binary protocol. Its current description can be found :ref:`here <box_protocol-iproto_protocol>`."

msgid "We consider the following connectors as references:"
msgstr ""

msgid "https://github.com/tarantool-php/client"

msgstr ""

msgid "You can look at them to understand how to do it right."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Tarantool ecosystem has connectors that are supported by the Tarantool team itself, and there are connectors that are developed and supported exclusively by the community. All of them have their pros and cons. See a `complete list of connectors and their recommended versions <https://www.tarantool.io/en/download/connectors>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you are using an existing connector from the community and want to implement new features or fix a bug, then send your PRs via GitHub to the desired repository."

msgid "How to become a maintainer"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maintainers are people who can merge PRs or commit to master. We expect maintainers to answer questions and tickets in time, and do code reviews."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you need to get a review but no one responds for a week, take a look at the Maintainers section of the ``README.md`` in the repository. Write to the person listed there. If you have not received an answer in 3-4 days, you can escalate the question `here <https://t.me/arturbrsg>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "A repository may have no maintainers (the Maintainers list in ``README.md`` is empty), or existing maintainers may be inactive. Then you can become a maintainer yourself. We think it's better if the repository is maintained by a newbie than if the repository is dead. So don't be shy: we love maintainers and help them figure it out."
msgstr ""

msgid "All you need to do is fill out `this form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1RihU9hQkbY5n7hU-3ZOr6t1L6cJKOlJcETowD_cNeOk/edit?usp=sharing>`_. Indicate which repository you want to access, the reason (inactivity, the maintainer is not responding), and how to contact you.
