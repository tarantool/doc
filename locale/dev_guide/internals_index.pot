For this it may use the latest snapshot file and any WAL files that were written after the snapshot. One complicating factor is that Tarantool has two engines -- the memtx data must be reconstructed entirely from the snapshot and the WAL files, while the vinyl data will be on disk but might require updating around the time of a checkpoint. (When a snapshot happens, Tarantool tells the vinyl engine to make a checkpoint, and the snapshot operation is rolled back if anything goes wrong, so vinyl's checkpoint is at least as fresh as the snapshot file.)"
