msgid "Create a new fiber."

msgid "Takes a fiber from the fiber cache, if it's not empty. Can fail only if there is not enough memory for the fiber structure or fiber stack."

msgid "Cancel the subject fiber (set ``FIBER_IS_CANCELLED`` flag)"
msgstr ""

msgid "If target fiber's flag ``FIBER_IS_CANCELLABLE`` set, then it would be woken up (maybe prematurely). Then current fiber yields until the target fiber is dead (or is woken up by :ref:`fiber_wakeup()<c_api-fiber-fiber_wakeup>`)."

msgid "Can be used for creating many fibers: corresponding fibers will not take ownership."

msgid "A conditional variable: a synchronization primitive that allow fibers in Tarantool's :ref:`cooperative multitasking <atomic-cooperative_multitasking>` environment to yield until some predicate is satisfied."
msgstr ""

msgid "Fiber conditions have two basic operations -- \"wait\" and \"signal\", -- where \"wait\" suspends the execution of a fiber (i.e. yields) until \"signal\" is called."

msgid "Unlike ``pthread_cond``, ``fiber_cond`` doesn't require mutex/latch wrapping."

msgid "Suspend the execution of the current fiber (i.e. yield) until :ref:`fiber_cond_signal() <c_api-fiber_cond_signal>` is called."
msgstr ""

msgid "Like ``pthread_cond``, ``fiber_cond`` can issue spurious wake ups caused by explicit :ref:`fiber_wakeup()<c_api-fiber-fiber_wakeup>` or :ref:`fiber_cancel()<c_api-fiber-fiber_cancel>` calls. It is highly recommended to wrap calls to this function into a loop and check the actual predicate and :ref:`fiber_is_cancelled()<c_api-fiber-fiber_is_cancelled>` on every iteration."
