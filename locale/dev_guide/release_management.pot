msgid "Release policy"
msgstr ""

msgid "A Tarantool release is identified by three digits, for example, 1.7.7. We use these digits according to their definitions provided at http://semver.org:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The first digit stands for MAJOR release. A **major** release may contain *incompatible changes*."
msgstr ""

msgid "The second digit stands for MINOR release, it does not contain incompatible changes, and is used for introducing backward-compatible *features*."
msgstr ""

msgid "The third digit is for PATCH releases that contain only backward-compatible *bug fixes*."
msgstr ""

msgid "In MINOR digit, we reflect how stable a release is:"
msgstr ""

msgid "0 meaning alpha,"
msgstr ""

msgid "1 meaning beta,"
msgstr ""

msgid "anything between 1 and 10 meaning stable, and"
msgstr ""

msgid "10 meaning LTS."
msgstr ""

msgid "So, each MAJOR release series goes through a development-maturity life cycle of MINOR releases, as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Alpha**. Once in every few months we release a few alpha versions, e.g. 2.0.1, 2.0.2."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alpha versions may contain incompatible changes, crashes and other bugs."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Beta**. Once major changes necessary to introduce new flagship features are ready, we release a few beta versions, e.g. 2.1.3, 2.1.4."
msgstr ""

msgid "Beta versions may contain crashes, but do not have incompatible changes, so can be used to develop new applications."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Stable**. Finally, after we see our beta versions run successfully in production, usually in a few more months, during which we fix all incoming bugs and add some minor features, we declare this MAJOR release series stable."
msgstr ""

msgid "Like Ubuntu, we distinguish two kinds of stable releases:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**LTS (Long Term Support)** releases that are supported for 3 years (community) and up to 5 years (paying customers). **LTS** release is identified by MINOR version 10."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Standard stable releases** are only supported a few months after the next stable is out."
msgstr ""

msgid "\"Support\" means that we continue fixing bugs in a release."
msgstr ""

msgid "We add commits simultaneously to three MAJOR releases:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**LTS** is a stable release which does not receive new features, and only gets backward compatible fixes. Hence, following the rules of semver, LTS release never has its MAJOR or MINOR version increased, and only gets PATCH level releases."
msgstr ""

msgid "**STABLE** is our current stable release, which may receive new features. When the next STABLE version is published, MINOR version is incremented. Between MINOR releases, we may have intermediate PATCH level releases as well, which will contain only bug fixes. We maintain PATCH level releases for two STABLE releases, the current and the previous one, to preserve support continuity."
msgstr ""

msgid "**NEXT** is our next MAJOR release, and it follows the maturity cycle described in the beginning. While NEXT release is in alpha state, its MINOR is frozen at 0 and is only increased when the release reaches BETA status. Once the NEXT release becomes STABLE, we switch the vehicle for delivery of minor features, designating the previous stable release as LTS, and releasing it with MINOR set to 10."
msgstr ""

msgid "To sum up, once a quarter we release:"
msgstr ""

msgid "the next LTS release, e.g. 2.10.6, 2.10.7 or 2.10.8"
msgstr ""

msgid "the next STABLE release, e.g. 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8"
msgstr ""

msgid "(optionally) an alpha or beta version of the NEXT release, e.g. 4.0.1, 4.0.2 or 4.0.3"
msgstr ""

msgid "In all supported releases, we also release a PATCH release as soon as we find and fix an outstanding CVE/vulnerability."
msgstr ""

msgid "We also publish nightly builds, and use the fourth slot in the version identifier to designate the nightly build number."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example version identifier:"
msgstr ""

msgid "2.0.3 - third alpha of 2.x release"
msgstr ""

msgid "2.1.3 - a beta of 2.x release"
msgstr ""

msgid "2.2 - a stable version of 2.x series, but not an LTS yet"
msgstr ""

msgid "2.10 - an LTS release"
msgstr ""

msgid "How to make a minor release"
msgstr ""

msgid "$ git tag -a 2.4 -m \"Next minor in 2.x series\"\n"
"$ vim CMakeLists.txt # edit CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH\n"
"$ git push --tags"
msgstr ""

msgid "A tag which is made on a git branch can be taken along with a merge, or left on the branch. The technique to \"keep the tag on the branch it was originally set on\" is to use ``--no-fast-forward`` when merging this branch."
msgstr ""

msgid "With ``--no-ff``, a merge changeset is created to represent the received changes, and only that merge changeset ends up in the destination branch. This technique can be useful when there are two active lines of development, e.g. \"stable\" and \"next\", and it's necessary to be able to tag both lines independently."
msgstr ""

msgid "To make sure that a tag doesn't end up in the destination branch, it is necessary to have the commit to which the tag is attached, \"stay on the original branch\". That's exactly what a merge with disabled \"fast-forward\" does -- creates a \"merge\" commit and adds it to both branches."
msgstr ""
