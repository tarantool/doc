msgstr ""

msgid "With sharding, the tuples of a tuple set are distributed to multiple nodes, with a Tarantool database server instance on each node. With this arrangement, each instance is handling only a subset of the total data, so larger loads can be handled by simply adding more computers to a network."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Tarantool `shard` module has facilities for creating shards, as well as analogues for the data-manipulation functions of the box library (select, insert, replace, update, delete)."
msgstr ""

msgid "First some terminology:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Consistent hash**"
msgstr ""

msgid "The `shard` module distributes according to a hash algorithm, that is, it applies a hash function to a tuple's primary-key value in order to decide which shard the tuple belongs to. The hash function is `consistent <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing>`_ so that changing the number of servers will not affect results for many keys. The specific hash function that the `shard` module uses is :ref:`digest.guava <digest-guava>` in the :codeitalic:`digest` module."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Instance**"
msgstr ""

msgid "A currently-running in-memory copy of the Tarantool server, sometimes called a \"server instance\". Usually each shard is associated with one instance, or, if both sharding and replicating are going on, each shard is associated with one replica set."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Queue**"
msgstr ""

msgid "A temporary list of recent update requests. Sometimes called \"batching\". Since updates to a sharded database can be slow, it may speed up throughput to send requests to a queue rather than wait for the update to finish on every node. The `shard` module has functions for adding requests to the queue, which it will process without further intervention. Queuing is optional."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Redundancy**"
msgstr ""

msgid "The number of replicated data copies in each shard."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Replica**"
msgstr ""

msgid "An instance which is part of a replica set."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Replica set**"
msgstr ""

msgid "Often a single shard is associated with a single instance; however, often the shard is replicated. When a shard is replicated, the multiple instances (\"replicas\"), which handle the shard's replicated data, are a \"replica set\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Replicated data**"
msgstr ""

msgid "A complete copy of the data. The `shard` module handles both sharding and replication. One shard can contain one or more replicated data copies. When a write occurs, the write is attempted on every replicated data copy in turn. The `shard` module does not use the built-in replication feature."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Shard**"
msgstr ""

msgid "A subset of the tuples in the database partitioned according to the value returned by the consistent hash function. Usually each shard is on a separate node, or a separate set of nodes (for example if redundancy = 3 then the shard will be on three nodes)."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Zone**"
msgstr ""

msgid "A physical location where the nodes are closely connected, with the same security and backup and access points. The simplest example of a zone is a single computer with a single Tarantool-server instance. A shard's replicated data copies should be in different zones."
msgstr ""

msgid "The `shard` package is distributed separately from the main `tarantool` package. To acquire it, do a separate installation:"

msgid "install with `yum` or `apt`, for example on Ubuntu say:"

msgid "or download from GitHub `tarantool/shard` and use the Lua files as described in the `README <https://github.com/tarantool/shard>`_."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "The most important function is:"
msgstr ""

msgid "shard.init(*shard-configuration*)"
