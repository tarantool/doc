msgid "With :ref:`console.listen() <console-listen>` function from ``console`` module, you can set up a port which can be used to open an administrative console to the server. This is for administrators to connect to a running instance and make requests. ``tt`` invokes ``console.listen()`` to create a control socket for each started instance."

Ideally, it should not be a TCP port at all, it should be a Unix domain socket, so that access to the server machine is required. Thus a typical port setup for admin console is:"
