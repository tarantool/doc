msgid "Tarantool is backward compatible between two adjacent versions. For example, you should have no or little trouble when upgrading from Tarantool 1.6 to 1.7, or from Tarantool 1.7 to 1.8. Meanwhile Tarantool 1.8 may have incompatible changes when migrating from Tarantool 1.6. to 1.8 directly."

msgid "How to upgrade from Tarantool 1.6 to 1.7 / 1.10"
msgstr ""

msgid "This procedure is for upgrading a standalone Tarantool instance in production from 1.6.x to 1.7.x (or to 1.10.x). Notice that this will **always imply a downtime**. To upgrade **without downtime**, you need several Tarantool servers running in a replication cluster (see :ref:`below <admin-upgrades_replication_cluster>`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tarantool 1.7 has an incompatible :ref:`.snap <internals-snapshot>` and :ref:`.xlog <internals-wal>` file format: 1.6 files are supported during upgrade, but you wonâ€™t be able to return to 1.6 after running under 1.7 for a while. It also renames a few configuration parameters, but old parameters are supported. The full list of breaking changes is available in `release notes for Tarantool 1.7 / 1.9 / 1.10 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/releases>`_."

msgstr ""

msgid "Check with application developers whether application files need to be updated due to incompatible changes (see `1.7 / 1.9 / 1.10 release notes <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/releases>`_). If yes, back up the old application files."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stop the Tarantool server."
msgstr ""

msgid "Make a copy of all data (see an appropriate hot backup procedure in :ref:`Backups <admin-backups>`) and the package from which the current (old) version was installed (for rollback purposes)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Update the Tarantool server. See installation instructions at Tarantool `download page <http://tarantool.org/download.html>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "Update the Tarantool database. Put the request ``box.schema.upgrade()`` inside a :doc:`box.once() </reference/reference_lua/box_once>` function in your Tarantool :ref:`initialization file <index-init_label>`. On startup, this will create new system spaces, update data type names (e.g. num -> unsigned, str -> string) and options in Tarantool system spaces."
msgstr ""

msgid "Update application files, if needed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Launch the updated Tarantool server using ``tarantoolctl`` or ``systemctl``."

msgid "Upgrading Tarantool in a replication cluster"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tarantool 1.7 (as well as Tarantool 1.9 and 1.10) can work as a :ref:`replica <replication-architecture>` for Tarantool 1.6 and vice versa. Replicas perform capability negotiation on handshake, and new 1.7 replication features are not used with 1.6 replicas. This allows upgrading clustered configurations."
msgstr ""

msgid "This procedure allows for a rolling upgrade **without downtime** and works for any cluster configuration: master-master or master-replica."
msgstr ""

msgid "Upgrade the master. The procedure is similar to upgrading a replica."
msgstr ""

msgid "Verify master installation:"

msgid "Start Tarantool with replica configuration to catch up."

msgid "Switch to master mode."

msgid "Upgrade the database on any master node in the cluster. Make the request ``box.schema.upgrade()``. This updates Tarantool system spaces to match the currently installed version of Tarantool. Changes are propagated to other nodes via the regular replication mechanism."
