msgid "The problem is described in the issue :tarantool-issue:`7932`. If two or more transactions happened simultaneously in Tarantool 2.1.2-2.2.0, their operations could be written to the write-ahead log mixed with each other. Starting from version 2.8.1, Tarantool recovers transactions atomically and expects all WAL entries between a transaction's ``begin`` and ``commit`` operations to belong to one transaction. If there is an operation belonging to another transaction, Tarantool fails to recover from such a WAL."
