msgstr ""

msgid "The ``box.ctl`` submodule contains two functions: ``wait_ro`` (wait until read-only) and ``wait_rw`` (wait until read-write). The functions are useful during initialization of a server."
msgstr ""

msgid "A particular use is for :ref:`box_once() <box-once>`. For example, when a replica is initializing, it may call a ``box.once()`` function while the server is still in read-only mode, and fail to make changes that are necessary only once before the replica is fully initialized. This could cause conflicts between a master and a replica if the master is in read-write mode and the replica is in read-only mode. Waiting until \"read only mode = false\" solves this problem."
msgstr ""

msgid "To see whether a function is already in read-only or read-write mode, check :ref:`box.info.ro <box_introspection-box_info>`."
