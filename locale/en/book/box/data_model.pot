msgid "**boolean**. A boolean is either ``true`` or ``false``. Example: ``true``."
msgstr ""

msgid "**integer**. The Tarantool integer type is for integers between -9223372036854775808 and 18446744073709551615, which is about 18 quintillion. This corresponds to number in Lua and to integer in MsgPack. Example: ``-2^63``."
msgstr ""

msgid "**unsigned**. The Tarantool unsigned type is for integers between 0 and 18446744073709551615. So it is a subset of integer. Example: ``123456``."
msgstr ""

msgid "**double**. The double field type exists mainly so that there will be an equivalent to Tarantool/SQL's :ref:`DOUBLE data type <sql_data_type_double>`. In `msgpuck.h <https://github.com/rtsisyk/msgpuck>`_ (Tarantool's interface to MsgPack) the storage type is MP_DOUBLE and the size of the encoded value is always 9 bytes. In Lua, 'double' fields can only contain non-integer numeric values and cdata values with double floating-point numbers. Examples: ``1.234``, ``-44``, ``1.447e+44``. |br| To avoid using the wrong kind of values inadvertently, use ``ffi.cast()`` when searching or changing 'double' fields. For example, instead of :samp:`{space_object}:insert`:code:`{`:samp:`{value}`:code:`}` say ``ffi = require('ffi') ...`` :samp:`{space_object}:insert`:code:`({ffi.cast('double',`:samp:`{value}`:code:`)})`.

msgstr ""

msgid "**number**. In Lua a number is double-precision floating-point, but a Tarantool 'number' field may have both integer and floating-point values. Tarantool will try to store a Lua number as floating-point if the value contains a decimal point or is very large (greater than 100 trillion = 1e14), otherwise Tarantool will store it as an integer. To ensure that even very large numbers are stored as integers, use the :ref:`tonumber64 <other-tonumber64>` function, or the LL (Long Long) suffix, or the ULL (Unsigned Long Long) suffix. Here are examples of numbers using regular notation, exponential notation, the ULL suffix and the ``tonumber64`` function: ``-55``, ``-2.7e+20``, ``100000000000000ULL``, ``tonumber64('18446744073709551615')``."
msgstr ""

msgid "**decimal**. The Tarantool decimal type is stored as a MsgPack ext (Extension). Values with the decimal type are not floating-point values although they may contain decimal points. They are exact with up to 38 digits of precision. Example: a value returned by a function in the :ref:`decimal <decimal>` module."
msgstr ""

msgid "**string**. A string is a variable-length sequence of bytes, usually represented with alphanumeric characters inside single quotes. In both Lua and MsgPack, strings are treated as binary data, with no attempts to determine a string's character set or to perform any string conversion -- unless there is an optional :ref:`collation <index-collation>`. So, usually, string sorting and comparison are done byte-by-byte, without any special collation rules applied. (Example: numbers are ordered by their point on the number line, so 2345 is greater than 500; meanwhile, strings are ordered by the encoding of the first byte, then the encoding of the second byte, and so on, so ``'2345'`` is less than ``'500'``.) Example: ``'A, B, C'``."
msgstr ""

msgid "**bin**. A bin (binary) value is not directly supported by Lua but there is a Tarantool type ``varbinary`` which is encoded as MsgPack binary.

msgid "Tarantool also maintains a set of :ref:`snapshot files <internals-snapshot>`. These files contain an on-disk copy of the entire data set for a given moment. Instead of reading every WAL file since the databases were created, the recovery process can load the latest snapshot file and then read only those WAL files that were produced after the snapshot file was made. After checkpointing, old WAL files can be removed to free up space."
msgstr ""

msgid "To force immediate creation of a snapshot file, you can use Tarantool's :doc:`box.snapshot() </reference/reference_lua/box_snapshot>` request. To enable automatic creation of snapshot files, you can use Tarantool's :ref:`checkpoint daemon <book_cfg_checkpoint_daemon>`. The checkpoint daemon sets intervals for forced checkpoints. It makes sure that the states of both memtx and vinyl storage engines are synchronized and saved to disk, and automatically removes old WAL files."
msgstr ""

msgid "Snapshot files can be created even if there is no WAL file."
msgstr ""

msgid "The memtx engine makes only regular checkpoints with the interval set in :ref:`checkpoint daemon <book_cfg_checkpoint_daemon>` configuration."

msgid "Operations"
msgstr ""

msgid "Data operations"
msgstr ""

msgid "The basic data operations supported in Tarantool are:"
msgstr ""

msgid "five data-manipulation operations (INSERT, UPDATE, UPSERT, DELETE, REPLACE), and"
msgstr ""

msgid "one data-retrieval operation (SELECT)."
msgstr ""

msgid "All of them are implemented as functions in :ref:`box.space <box_space>` submodule."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Examples:**"
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`INSERT <box_space-insert>`: Add a new tuple to space 'tester'."
msgstr ""

msgid "The first field, field[1], will be 999 (MsgPack type is `integer`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The second field, field[2], will be 'Taranto' (MsgPack type is `string`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "tarantool> box.space.tester:insert{999, 'Taranto'}"
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`UPDATE <box_space-update>`: Update the tuple, changing field field[2]."
msgstr ""

msgid "The clause \"{999}\", which has the value to look up in the index of the tuple's primary-key field, is mandatory, because ``update()`` requests must always have a clause that specifies a unique key, which in this case is field[1]."
msgstr ""

msgid "The clause \"{{'=', 2, 'Tarantino'}}\" specifies that assignment will happen to field[2] with the new value."
msgstr ""

msgid "tarantool> box.space.tester:update({999}, {{'=', 2, 'Tarantino'}})"
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`UPSERT <box_space-upsert>`: Upsert the tuple, changing field field[2] again."
msgstr ""

msgid "The syntax of ``upsert()`` is similar to the syntax of ``update()``. However, the execution logic of these two requests is different. UPSERT is either UPDATE or INSERT, depending on the database's state. Also, UPSERT execution is postponed until after transaction commit, so, unlike ``update()``, ``upsert()`` doesn't return data back."
msgstr ""

msgid "tarantool> box.space.tester:upsert({999, 'Taranted'}, {{'=', 2, 'Tarantism'}})"
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`REPLACE <box_space-replace>`: Replace the tuple, adding a new field."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is also possible with the ``update()`` request, but the ``update()`` request is usually more complicated."
msgstr ""

msgid "tarantool> box.space.tester:replace{999, 'Tarantella', 'Tarantula'}"
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`SELECT <box_space-select>`: Retrieve the tuple."
msgstr ""

msgid "The clause \"{999}\" is still mandatory, although it does not have to mention the primary key."
msgstr ""

msgid "tarantool> box.space.tester:select{999}"
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`DELETE <box_space-delete>`: Delete the tuple."
msgstr ""

msgid "In this example, we identify the primary-key field."
msgstr ""

msgid "tarantool> box.space.tester:delete{999}"
msgstr ""

msgid "Summarizing the examples:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Functions ``insert`` and ``replace`` accept a tuple (where a primary key comes as part of the tuple)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Function ``upsert`` accepts a tuple (where a primary key comes as part of the tuple), and also the update operations to execute."
msgstr ""

msgid "Function ``delete`` accepts a full key of any unique index (primary or secondary)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Function ``update`` accepts a full key of any unique index (primary or secondary), and also the operations to execute."
msgstr ""

msgid "Function ``select`` accepts any key: primary/secondary, unique/non-unique, full/partial."
msgstr ""

msgid "See reference on ``box.space`` for more :ref:`details on using data operations <box_space-operations-detailed-examples>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Besides Lua, you can use :ref:`Perl, PHP, Python or other programming language connectors <index-box_connectors>`. The client server protocol is open and documented. See this :ref:`annotated BNF <box_protocol-iproto_protocol>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Complexity factors"
msgstr ""

msgid "In reference for :ref:`box.space <box_space>` and :doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_index` submodules, there are notes about which complexity factors might affect the resource usage of each function."
msgstr ""

msgid "Complexity factor"
msgstr ""

msgid "Effect"
msgstr ""

msgid "Index size"
msgstr ""

msgid "The number of index keys is the same as the number of tuples in the data set. For a TREE index, if there are more keys, then the lookup time will be greater, although of course the effect is not linear. For a HASH index, if there are more keys, then there is more RAM used, but the number of low-level steps tends to remain constant."
msgstr ""

msgid "Typically, a HASH index is faster than a TREE index if the number of tuples in the space is greater than one."
msgstr ""

msgid "Number of indexes accessed"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ordinarily, only one index is accessed to retrieve one tuple. But to update the tuple, there must be N accesses if the space has N different indexes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note re storage engine: Vinyl optimizes away such accesses if secondary index fields are unchanged by the update. So, this complexity factor applies only to memtx, since it always makes a full-tuple copy on every update."
msgstr ""

msgid "Number of tuples accessed"
msgstr ""

msgid "A few requests, for example SELECT, can retrieve multiple tuples. This factor is usually less important than the others."
msgstr ""

msgid "WAL settings"
msgstr ""

msgid "The important setting for the write-ahead log is :ref:`wal_mode <cfg_binary_logging_snapshots-wal_mode>`. If the setting causes no writing or delayed writing, this factor is unimportant. If the setting causes every data-change request to wait for writing to finish on a slow device, this factor is more important than all the others."
