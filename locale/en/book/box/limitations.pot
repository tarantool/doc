msgid "For TREE or HASH indexes, the maximum is 255 (``box.schema.INDEX_PART_MAX``). For :ref:`RTREE <box_index-rtree>` indexes, the maximum is 1 but the field is an ARRAY of up to 20 dimensions. For BITSET indexes, the maximum is 1."

msgid "**Number of bytes in a tuple**"
msgstr ""

msgid "The maximal number of bytes in a tuple is roughly equal to :ref:`memtx_max_tuple_size <cfg_storage-memtx_max_tuple_size>` or :ref:`vinyl_max_tuple_size <cfg_storage-vinyl_max_tuple_size>` (with a metadata overhead of about 20 bytes per tuple, which is added on top of useful bytes). By default, the value of either ``memtx_max_tuple_size`` or ``vinyl_max_tuple_size`` is 1,048,576. To increase it, specify a larger value when starting the Tarantool instance. For example, ``box.cfg{memtx_max_tuple_size=2*1048576}``."
