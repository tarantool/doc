msgid "All triggers have the following characteristics:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Triggers are defined only by the :ref:`'admin' user <authentication-"
"owners_privileges>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Triggers are stored in the Tarantool instance's memory, not in the database."
" Therefore triggers disappear when the instance is shut down. To make them "
"permanent, put function definitions and trigger settings into Tarantool's "
":ref:`initialization script <index-init_label>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Triggers have low overhead. If a trigger is not defined, then the overhead "
"is minimal: merely a pointer dereference and check. If a trigger is defined,"
" then its overhead is equivalent to the overhead of calling a function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There can be multiple triggers for one event. In this case, triggers are "
"executed in the reverse order that they were defined in. (Exception: member "
"triggers are executed in the order that they appear in the member list.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Triggers must work within the event context. However, effects are undefined "
"if a function contains requests which normally could not occur immediately "
"after the event, but only before the return from the event. For example, "
"putting `os.exit() <http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-os.exit>`_"
" or :doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_txn_management/rollback` in a trigger"
" function would be bringing in requests outside the event context."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Triggers are replaceable. The request to \"redefine a trigger\" implies "
"passing a new trigger function and an old trigger function to one of the "
":samp:`on_{event}` functions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :samp:`on_{event}` functions all have parameters which are function "
"pointers, and they all return function pointers. Remember that a Lua "
"function definition such as ``function f() x = x + 1 end`` is the same as "
"``f = function () x = x + 1 end`` - in both cases ``f`` gets a function "
"pointer. And ``trigger = box.session.on_connect(f)`` is the same as "
"``trigger = box.session.on_connect(function () x = x + 1 end)`` - in both "
"cases ``trigger`` gets the function pointer which was passed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can call any :samp:`on_{event}` function with no arguments to get a list"
" of its triggers. For example, use ``box.session.on_connect()`` to return a "
"table of all connect-trigger functions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Triggers can be useful in solving problems with replication. See details in "
":ref:`Resolving replication conflicts <replication-problem_solving>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Example:**"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here we log connect and disconnect events into Tarantool server log."
