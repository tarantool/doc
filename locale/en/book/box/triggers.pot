msgid "Then the server will store the callback function and call it when the corresponding event happens."
msgstr ""

msgid "All triggers have the following characteristics:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Triggers are defined only by the :ref:`'admin' user <authentication-owners_privileges>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Triggers are stored in the Tarantool instance's memory, not in the database. Therefore triggers disappear when the instance is shut down. To make them permanent, put function definitions and trigger settings into Tarantool's :ref:`initialization script <index-init_label>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Triggers have low overhead. If a trigger is not defined, then the overhead is minimal: merely a pointer dereference and check. If a trigger is defined, then its overhead is equivalent to the overhead of calling a function."
msgstr ""

msgid "There can be multiple triggers for one event. In this case, triggers are executed in the reverse order that they were defined in. (Exception: member triggers are executed in the order that they appear in the member list.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Triggers must work within the event context. However, effects are undefined if a function contains requests which normally could not occur immediately after the event, but only before the return from the event. For example, putting `os.exit() <http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-os.exit>`_ or :doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_txn_management/rollback` in a trigger function would be bringing in requests outside the event context."
msgstr ""

msgid "Triggers are replaceable. The request to \"redefine a trigger\" implies passing a new trigger function and an old trigger function to one of the :samp:`on_{event}` functions."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :samp:`on_{event}` functions all have parameters which are function pointers, and they all return function pointers. Remember that a Lua function definition such as ``function f() x = x + 1 end`` is the same as ``f = function () x = x + 1 end`` - in both cases ``f`` gets a function pointer. And ``trigger = box.session.on_connect(f)`` is the same as ``trigger = box.session.on_connect(function () x = x + 1 end)`` - in both cases ``trigger`` gets the function pointer which was passed."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can call any :samp:`on_{event}` function with no arguments to get a list of its triggers. For example, use ``box.session.on_connect()`` to return a table of all connect-trigger functions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Triggers can be useful in solving problems with replication. See details in :ref:`Resolving replication conflicts <replication-problem_solving>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Example:**"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here we log connect and disconnect events into Tarantool server log."
msgstr ""
