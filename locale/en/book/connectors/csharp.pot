msgid "The most commonly used C# driver is `progaudi.tarantool <https://github.com/progaudi/progaudi.tarantool>`__, previously named ``tarantool-csharp``. It is not supplied as part of the Tarantool repository; it must be installed separately. The makers recommend `cross-platform installation using Nuget <https://www.nuget.org/packages/progaudi.tarantool>`__."
