msgid "The most commonly used node.js driver is the `Node Tarantool driver <https://github.com/KlonD90/node-tarantool-driver>`_. It is not supplied as part of the Tarantool repository; it must be installed separately. The most common way to install it is with `npm <https://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-node-package-manager/>`_. For example, on Ubuntu, the installation could look like this after npm has been installed:"

msgid "Here is a complete node.js program that inserts ``[99999,'BB']`` into ``space[999]`` via the node.js API. Before trying to run, check that the server instance is :ref:`listening <cfg_basic-listen>` at ``localhost:3301`` and that the space ``examples`` exists, as :ref:`described earlier <index-connector_setting>`. To run, paste the code into a file named :file:`example.rs` and say ``node example.rs``. The program will connect using an application-specific definition of the space. The program will open a socket connection with the Tarantool instance at ``localhost:3301``, then send an :ref:`INSERT <box_space-insert>` request, then — if all is well — end after saying \"Insert succeeded\". If Tarantool is not running on ``localhost`` with listen port = 3301, the program will print “Connect failed”. If :ref:`the 'guest' user <box_space-user>` does not have authorization to connect, the program will print \"Auth failed\". If the insert request fails for any reason, for example because the tuple already exists, the program will print \"Insert failed\"."
