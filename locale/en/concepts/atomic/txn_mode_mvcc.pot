msgid "Since version :doc:`2.6.1 </release/2.6.1>`, Tarantool has another transaction behavior mode that allows :ref:`\"yielding\" <app-yields>` inside a :ref:`memtx <engines-chapter>` transaction. This is controlled by the *transaction manager*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/concepts/atomic/txn_mode_mvcc.rst:12
msgid "This mode allows concurrent transactions but may cause conflicts. You can use this mode on the :ref:`memtx <engines-chapter>` storage engine. The :ref:`vinyl <engines-chapter>` storage engine also supports MVCC mode, but has a different implementation."

msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/concepts/atomic/txn_mode_mvcc.rst:31
msgid "*MVCC* -- multi version concurrency control engine, which stores all change actions of all transactions. It also creates the transaction view of the database state and a read view (a fixed state of the database that is never changed by other transactions) when necessary."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Conflict manager* -- a manager that tracks changes to transactions and determines their correctness in the serialization order. The conflict manager declares transactions to be in conflict or sends transactions to read views when necessary."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/concepts/atomic/txn_mode_mvcc.rst:40
msgid "Since version :doc:`2.10.1 </release/2.10.1>`, the conflict manager detects conflicts right after the first one of several conflicting transactions is committed. After this moment, any CRUD operations in the conflicted transaction will result in errors until the transaction is rolled back."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/concepts/atomic/txn_mode_mvcc.rst:45
msgid "The transaction manager also provides a non-classical *snapshot* isolation level -- this snapshot is not necessarily tied to the start time of the transaction, like the classical snapshot where a transaction can get a consistent snapshot of the database. The conflict manager decides if and when each transaction gets which snapshot. This avoids some conflicts compared to the classic snapshot isolation approach."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/concepts/atomic/txn_mode_mvcc.rst:52
msgid "Currently, the :ref:`isolation level <transaction_model_levels>` of BITSET and RTREE indexes in MVCC transaction mode is *read-committed* (not *serializable*, as stated). If a transaction uses these indexes, it can read committed or confirmed data (depending on the isolation level). However, the indexes are subject to different anomalies that can make them unserializable."
