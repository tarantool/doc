msgid "The primary difference between memtx and vinyl is that memtx is an in-memory engine while vinyl is an on-disk engine. An in-memory storage engine is generally faster (each query is usually run under 1 ms), and the memtx engine is justifiably the default for Tarantool. But on-disk engine such as vinyl is preferable when the database is larger than the available memory, and adding more memory is not a realistic option."
