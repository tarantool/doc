#: ../../doc/concepts/replication/repl_architecture.rst:19
msgid "A replica gets all updates from the master by continuously fetching and applying its :ref:`write-ahead log (WAL) <internals-wal>`. Each record in the WAL represents a single Tarantool data-change request such as :ref:`INSERT <box_space-insert>`, :ref:`UPDATE <box_space-update>`, or :ref:`DELETE <box_space-delete>`, and is assigned a monotonically growing log sequence number (**LSN**). In essence, Tarantool replication is **row-based**: each data-change request is fully deterministic and operates on a single :ref:`tuple <index-box_tuple>`. However, unlike a classical row-based log, which contains entire copies of the changed rows, Tarantool's WAL contains copies of the requests. For example, for UPDATE requests, Tarantool only stores the primary key of the row and the update operations to save space."

msgid "Additionally, each instance in a replica set is assigned its own UUID, when it joins the replica set. It is called an **instance UUID** and is a globally unique identifier. The instance UUID is checked to ensure that instances do not join a different replica set, e.g. because of a configuration error. A unique instance identifier is also necessary to apply rows originating from different masters only once, that is, to implement multi-master replication. This is why each row in the write-ahead log, in addition to its log sequence number, stores the instance identifier of the instance on which it was created. But using a UUID as such an identifier would take too much space in the write-ahead log, thus a shorter integer number is assigned to the instance when it joins a replica set. This number is then used to refer to the instance in the write-ahead log. It is called **instance ID**. All identifiers are stored in the system space :ref:`box.space._cluster <box_space-cluster>`, for example:"
