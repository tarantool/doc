"*   This is a bullet list.\n"

msgid "Wrapping text"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's good practice to wrap lines in documentation source text. It makes "
"source better readable and results in lesser ``git diff``'s. The recommended"
" limit is 80 characters per line for plain text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In new documents, try to wrap lines by sentences, or by parts of a complex "
"sentence. Don't wrap formatted text if it affects rST readability and/or "
"HTML output. However, wrapping with proper indentation shouldn't break "
"things."

msgid "Indentation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In rST, indents play exactly the same role as in Python: they denote object "
"boundaries and nesting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, a list starts with a marker, then come some spaces and text. "
"From there, all lines relating to that list item must be at the same "
"indentation level. We can continue the list item by creating a second "
"paragraph in it. To do that we have to leave it at the same level."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We can put a new object inside: another list, or a block of code. Then we "
"have to indent 4 more spaces."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's best if all indents are multiples of 4 spaces, even in lists. Otherwise"
" the document is not consistent. Also, it is much easier to put indents with"
" tabs than manually."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that you have to use two or three spaces instead of one. It is allowed "
"in rST markup:"

msgid "Making comments"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes we may need to leave comments in an rST file. To make Sphinx "
"ignore some text during processing, use the following per-line notation with"
" ``.. //`` as the comment marker:"
msgstr ""

msgid ".. // your comment here"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The starting characters ``.. //`` do not interfere with the other rST "
"markup, and they are easy to find both visually and using ``grep``. To find "
"comments in source files, go ahead with something like this:"
