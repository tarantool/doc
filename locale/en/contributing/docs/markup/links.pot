"To create a link to another document in our documentation, we use the "

msgid ":doc:`box.error reference </reference/reference_lua/box_error>`"

"Our convention is to put the full path to the referred document so that we "
"can easily replace the path if it changes. Note that we can omit the "
"``.rst`` part of the filename."

"You can use the target document's title as the link text. To do so, omit the"

msgid ""
"To generate a link to the certain place in the page, we use the ``:ref:`` "
"role. For this purpose, we add our own labels for linking to any place in "
"this documentation."

msgid "Our naming convention is as follows:"

msgid "**Example:**"

msgid "where:"

msgid "``c_api`` is the directory name,"

msgid "``box_index`` is the file name (without \".rst\"), and"
msgstr ""

msgid "``iterator_type`` is the tag."

"Use a dash \"-\" to delimit the path and the file name. In the documentation"
" source, we use only underscores \"_\" in paths and file names, reserving "
"dash \"-\" as the delimiter for local links."

msgid ""
"The tag can be anything meaningful. The only guideline is for Tarantool "
"syntax items (such as members), where the preferred tag syntax is "
"``module_or_object_name dash member_name``. For example, ``box_space-drop``."
