msgid "The purpose of using terms is writing concisely and unambiguously, which is good for the readers. But selecting terms is hard. Often, the community favors two or more terms for one concept, so there's no obvious choice. Selecting and consistently using any of them is much better than not making a choice and using a random term every time. This is why it's also helpful to restrict the usage of some terms explicitly."

#: ../../doc/contributing/docs/terms.rst:51
msgid "A restricted term is a word that the authors explicitly prohibited to use for denoting a :term:`concept`. Such a word is sometimes used as a :term:`term` for the same :term:`concept` elsewhere -- in the community, in books, or in other product documentation. Sometimes this word is used to denote a similar but different concept. In this case, the right choice of terms helps us differentiate between concepts."
