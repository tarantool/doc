msgid "These guidelines are updated on the on-demand basis, covering only those issues that cause pains to the existing writers. At this point, we do not aim to come up with an exhaustive Documentation Style Guide for the Tarantool project."

msgid "Wrapping text"
msgstr ""

msgid "The limit is 80 characters per line for plain text, and no limit for any other constructions when wrapping affects ReST readability and/or HTML output. Also, it makes no sense to wrap text into lines shorter than 80 characters unless you have a good reason to do so."
msgstr ""

msgid "The 80-character limit comes from the ISO/ANSI 80x24 screen resolution, and it's unlikely that readers/writers will use 80-character consoles. Yet it's still a standard for many coding guidelines (including Tarantool). As for writers, the benefit is that an 80-character page guide allows keeping the text window rather narrow most of the time, leaving more space for other applications in a wide-screen environment."

msgid "Formatting code snippets"
msgstr ""

msgid "For code snippets, we mainly use the ``code-block`` directive with an appropriate highlighting language. The most commonly used highlighting languages are:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``.. code-block:: tarantoolsession``"
msgstr ""

msgid "``.. code-block:: console``"
msgstr ""

msgid "``.. code-block:: lua``"
msgstr ""

msgid "For example (a code snippet in Lua):"
msgstr ""

msgid "for page in paged_iter(\"X\", 10) do\n"
"  print(\"New Page. Number Of Tuples = \" .. #page)\n"
"  for i=1,#page,1 do print(page[i]) end\n"
"end"
msgstr ""

msgid "In rare cases, when we need custom highlight for specific parts of a code snippet and the ``code-block`` directive is not enough, we use the per-line ``codenormal`` directive together and explicit output formatting (defined in :file:`doc/sphinx/_static/sphinx_design.css`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Examples:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Function syntax (the placeholder `space-name` is displayed in italics):"
msgstr ""

msgid ":codenormal:`box.space.`:codeitalic:`space-name`:codenormal:`:create_index('index-name')`"
msgstr ""

msgid "A tdb session (user input is in bold, command prompt is in blue, computer output is in green):"
msgstr ""

msgid "$ :codebold:`tarantool example.lua`\n"
":codeblue:`(TDB)`  :codegreen:`Tarantool debugger v.0.0.3. Type h for help`\n"
"example.lua\n"
":codeblue:`(TDB)`  :codegreen:`[example.lua]`\n"
":codeblue:`(TDB)`  :codenormal:`3: i = 1`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Warning: Every entry of explicit output formatting (``codenormal``, ``codebold``, etc) tends to cause troubles when this documentation is translated to other languages. Please avoid using explicit output formatting unless it is REALLY needed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using separated links"
msgstr ""

msgid "Avoid separating the link and the target definition (ref), like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is a paragraph that contains `a link`_.\n"
"\n"
".. _a link: http://example.com/"
msgstr ""

msgid "Use non-separated links instead:"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is a paragraph that contains `a link <http://example.com/>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "Warning: Every separated link tends to cause troubles when this documentation is translated to other languages. Please avoid using separated links unless it is REALLY needed (e.g. in tables)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating labels for local links"
msgstr ""

msgid "We avoid using links that sphinx generates automatically for most objects. Instead, we add our own labels for linking to any place in this documentation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Our naming convention is as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Character set: a through z, 0 through 9, dash, underscore."
msgstr ""

msgid "Format: ``path dash filename dash tag``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Example: ``_c_api-box_index-iterator_type`` |br| where: |br| ``c_api`` is the directory name, |br| ``box_index`` is the file name (without \".rst\"), and |br| ``iterator_type`` is the tag."
msgstr ""

msgid "The file name is useful for knowing, when you see \"ref\", where it is pointing to. And if the file name is meaningful, you see that better."
msgstr ""

msgid "The file name alone, without a path, is enough when the file name is unique within ``doc/sphinx``. So, for ``fiber.rst`` it should be just \"fiber\", not \"reference-fiber\". While for \"index.rst\" (we have a handful of \"index.rst\" in different directories) please specify the path before the file name, e.g. \"reference-index\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use a dash \"-\" to delimit the path and the file name. In the documentation source, we use only underscores \"_\" in paths and file names, reserving dash \"-\" as the delimiter for local links."
msgstr ""

msgid "The tag can be anything meaningful. The only guideline is for Tarantool syntax items (such as members), where the preferred tag syntax is ``module_or_object_name dash member_name``. For example, ``box_space-drop``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Making comments"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sometimes we may need to leave comments in a ReST file. To make sphinx ignore some text during processing, use the following per-line notation with \".. //\" as the comment marker:"
msgstr ""

msgid ".. // your comment here"
msgstr ""

msgid "The starting symbols \".. //\" do not interfere with the other ReST markup, and they are easy to find both visually and using grep. There are no symbols to escape in grep search, just go ahead with something like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "$ grep \".. //\" doc/sphinx/dev_guide/*.rst"
msgstr ""

msgid "These comments don't work properly in nested documentation, though (e.g. if you leave a comment in module -> object -> method, sphinx ignores the comment and all nested content that follows in the method description)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Language and style issues"
msgstr ""

msgid "US vs British spelling"
msgstr ""

msgid "We use English US spelling."
msgstr ""

msgid "Instance vs server"
msgstr ""

msgid "We say \"instance\" rather than \"server\" to refer to an instance of Tarantool server. This keeps the manual terminology consistent with names like ``/etc/tarantool/instances.enabled`` in the Tarantool environment."
msgstr ""

msgid "Wrong usage: \"Replication allows multiple Tarantool *servers* to work on copies of the same databases.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "Correct usage: \"Replication allows multiple Tarantool *instances* to work on copies of the same databases.\""
