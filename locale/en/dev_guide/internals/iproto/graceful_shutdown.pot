msgid "The graceful shutdown protocol is a mechanism that helps to prevent data loss in requests in case of a shutdown command. According to the protocol, when a server receives an ``os.exit()`` command or a ``SIGTERM``  signal, it does not exit immediately. Instead of that, first, the server stops listening for new connections. Then, the server sends the shutdown packets to all connections that support the graceful shutdown protocol. When a client is notified about the upcoming server exit, it stops serving any new requests and waits for active requests to complete before closing the connections. Once all connections are terminated, the server will be shut down."

msgid "The protocol uses the event subscription system. That is, the feature is available if the server supports the :ref:`box.shutdown <system-events_box-shutdown>` event and ``IPROTO_WATCH``. For more information about it, see :ref:`reference for the event watchers <box-watchers>` and the :ref:`corresponding page in the Binary Protocol section <box-protocol-watchers>`."

msgid "Then the :ref:`box.shutdown <system-events_box-shutdown>` event is generated. The server broadcasts it to all subscribed remote watchers (see :ref:`IPROTO_WATCH <box_protocol-watch>`). That is, the server calls :ref:`box.broadcast('box.shutdown', true) <box-broadcast>` from the :ref:`box.ctl.on_shutdown() <box_ctl-on_shutdown>` trigger callback. Once this is done, the server stops listening for new connections."
