msgid "The recovery process begins when box.cfg{} happens for the first time after the Tarantool server instance starts."
msgstr ""

msgid "The recovery process must recover the databases as of the moment when the instance was last shut down. For this it may use the latest snapshot file and any WAL files that were written after the snapshot. One complicating factor is that Tarantool has two engines -- the memtx data must be reconstructed entirely from the snapshot and the WAL files, while the vinyl data will be on disk but might require updating around the time of a checkpoint. (When a snapshot happens, Tarantool tells the vinyl engine to make a checkpoint, and the snapshot operation is rolled back if anything goes wrong, so vinyl's checkpoint is at least as fresh as the snapshot file.)"

msgid "Step 1"
msgstr ""

msgid "Read the configuration parameters in the ``box.cfg{}`` request. Parameters which affect recovery may include :ref:`work_dir <cfg_basic-work_dir>`, :ref:`wal_dir <cfg_basic-wal_dir>`, :ref:`memtx_dir <cfg_basic-memtx_dir>`, :ref:`vinyl_dir <cfg_basic-vinyl_dir>` and :ref:`force_recovery <cfg_binary_logging_snapshots-force_recovery>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Step 2"
msgstr ""

msgid "Find the latest snapshot file. Use its data to reconstruct the in-memory databases. Instruct the vinyl engine to recover to the latest checkpoint."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are actually two variations of the reconstruction procedure for memtx databases, depending on whether the recovery process is \"default\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the recovery process is default (``force_recovery`` is ``false``), memtx can read data in the snapshot with all indexes disabled. First, all tuples are read into memory. Then, primary keys are built in bulk, taking advantage of the fact that the data is already sorted by primary key within each space."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the recovery process is non-default (``force_recovery`` is ``true``), Tarantool performs additional checking. Indexes are enabled at the start, and tuples are added one by one. This means that any unique-key constraint violations will be caught, and any duplicates will be skipped. Normally there will be no constraint violations or duplicates, so these checks are only made if an error has occurred."
msgstr ""

msgid "Step 3"
msgstr ""

msgid "Find the WAL file that was made at the time of, or after, the snapshot file. Read its log entries until the log-entry LSN is greater than the LSN of the snapshot, or greater than the LSN of the vinyl checkpoint. This is the recovery process's \"start position\"; it matches the current state of the engines."
msgstr ""

msgid "Step 4"
msgstr ""

msgid "Redo the log entries, from the start position to the end of the WAL. The engine skips a redo instruction if it is older than the engine's checkpoint."
msgstr ""

msgid "Step 5"
msgstr ""

msgid "For the memtx engine, re-create all secondary indexes."
