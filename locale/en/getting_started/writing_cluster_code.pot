msgid "In the \"Getting Started\" tutorial, we wrote the application code directly in the browser. We used the file ``config.yml`` to describe HTTP endpoint handlers. This is a convenient and fast way to write code that allows you to use Tarantool as a repository without any additional HTTP service. This functionality is implemented through the ``cartridge-extensions`` module. It is also included in the tutorial default application."
