msgid "Further we walk you through key programming practices that will give you a good start in writing Lua applications for Tarantool. We will implement a real microservice based on Tarantool! It is a backend for a simplified version of `Pokémon Go <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Go>`_, a location-based augmented reality game launched in mid-2016."

Next, we have multiple players who can send catch-a-pokémon requests to the server (which runs our Tarantool microservice). The server responds whether the pokémon is caught or not, increases the player's pokémon counter if yes, and triggers the respawn-a-pokémon method that spawns a new pokémon at the same location in a while."
