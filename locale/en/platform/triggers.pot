msgid "Triggers have low overhead. If a trigger is not defined, then the overhead is minimal: merely a pointer dereference and check. If a trigger is defined, then its overhead is equivalent to the overhead of calling a function."

msgid "Triggers must work within the event context, that is, operate variables passed as the trigger function arguments. Triggers should not affect the global state of the program or change things unrelated to the event. If a trigger performs such calls as, for example, `os.exit() <http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-os.exit>`_ or :doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_txn_management/rollback`, the result of its execution is undefined."

msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/concepts/triggers.rst:60
msgid "The :samp:`on_{event}` functions all have parameters which are function pointers, and they all return function pointers. Remember that a Lua function definition such as ``function f() x = x + 1 end`` is the same as ``f = function () x = x + 1 end`` - in both cases ``f`` gets a function pointer. And ``trigger = box.session.on_connect(f)`` is the same as ``trigger = box.session.on_connect(function () x = x + 1 end)`` - in both cases ``trigger`` gets the function pointer which was passed."
