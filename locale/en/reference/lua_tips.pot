"The Lua syntax for :ref:`data-manipulation functions <index-box_data-"
"operations>` can vary. Here are examples of the variations with ``select()``"
" requests. The same rules exist for the other data-manipulation functions."

msgid ""
"Every one of the examples does the same thing: select a tuple set from a "
"space named 'tester' where the primary-key field value equals 1. For these "
"examples, we assume that the numeric id of 'tester' is 512, which happens to"
" be the case in our sandbox example only."

msgid "First, there are three **object reference variations**:"

"-- #1 module . submodule . name\n"
"tarantool> box.space.tester:select{1}\n"
"-- #2 replace name with a literal in square brackets\n"

"-- #3 use a variable for the entire object reference\n"
"tarantool> s = box.space.tester\n"
"tarantool> s:select{1}"

msgid ""
"Examples in this manual usually have the \":samp:`box.space.{tester}:`\" "
"form (#1). However, this is a matter of user preference and all the "
"variations exist in the wild."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also, descriptions in this manual use the syntax \"``space_object:``\" for "
"references to objects which are spaces, and \"``index_object:``\" for "
"references to objects which are indexes (for example "
":samp:`box.space.{tester}.index.{primary}:`)."

"Lua allows to omit parentheses ``()`` when invoking a function if its only "
"argument is a Lua table, and we use it sometimes in our examples. This is "
"why ``select{1}`` is equivalent to ``select({1})``. Literal values such as "
"``1`` (a scalar value) or ``{1}`` (a Lua table value) may be replaced by "
"variable names, as in examples #6 and #7."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Although there are special cases where braces can be omitted, they are "
"preferable because they signal \"Lua table\". Examples and descriptions in "
"this manual have the ``{1}`` form. However, this too is a matter of user "
"preference and all the variations exist in the wild."

msgid "Rules for object names"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Database objects have loose **rules for names**: the maximum length is 65000"
" bytes (not characters), and almost any legal Unicode character is allowed, "
"including spaces, ideograms and punctuation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In those cases, to prevent confusion with Lua operators and separators, "
"object references should have the literal-in-square-brackets form (#2), or "
"the variable form (#3). For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"tarantool> box.space['1*A']:select{1}\n"
