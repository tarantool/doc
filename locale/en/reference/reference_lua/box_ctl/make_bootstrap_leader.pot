msgid "To be able to make the instance a bootstrap leader manually, the :ref:`replication.bootstrap_strategy <configuration_reference_replication_bootstrap_strategy>` configuration option should be set to ``supervised``. In this case, the instances do not choose a bootstrap leader automatically but wait for it to be appointed manually. Configuration fails if no bootstrap leader is appointed during a :ref:`replication.connect_timeout <configuration_reference_replication_connect_timeout>`."
