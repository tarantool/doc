"The ``box.ctl`` submodule also contains two functions for the two "
":ref:`server trigger <triggers>` definitions: ``on_shutdown`` and "
"``on_schema_init``. Please, familiarize yourself with the mechanism of "
"trigger functions before using them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a \"schema_init :ref:`trigger <triggers>`\". The ``trigger-function``"
" will be executed when :ref:`box.cfg{} <index-book_cfg>` happens for the "
"first time. That is, the ``schema_init`` trigger is called before the "
"server's configuration and recovery begins, and therefore "
"``box.ctl.on_schema_init`` must be called before ``box.cfg`` is called."

"A common use is: make a ``schema_init`` trigger function which creates a "
"``before_replace`` trigger function on a system space. Thus, since system "
"spaces are created when the server starts, the ``before_replace`` triggers "
"will be activated for each tuple in each system space. For example, such a "
"trigger could change the storage engine of a given space, or make a given "
"space :ref:`replica-local <replication-local>` while a replica is being "
"bootstrapped. Making such a change after ``box.cfg`` is not reliable because"
" other connections might use the database before the change is made."

msgid "**Example:**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Suppose that, before the server is fully up and ready for connections, you "
"want to make sure that the engine of space ``space_name`` is vinyl. So you "
"want to make a trigger that will be activated when a tuple is inserted in "
"the ``_space`` system space. In this case you could end up with a master "
"that has space-name with ``engine='memtx'`` and a replica that has "
"space_name with ``engine='vinyl'``, with the same contents."
