msgid "For :ref:`synchronous transactions <how-to-repl_sync>` it is possible that a new leader will be chosen but the transactions of the old leader have not been completed. Therefore to finalize the transaction, the function ``box.ctl.promote()`` should be called, as mentioned in the notes for :ref:`leader election <repl_leader_elect_important>`. The old name for this function is ``box.ctl.clear_synchro_queue()``."
