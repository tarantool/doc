msgid "A watcher is a :doc:`callback </concepts/triggers>` that is invoked when a state change occurs. To register a local watcher, use the ``box.watch()`` function. To create a remote watcher, use the ``watch()`` function from the ``net.box`` module. Note that it is possible to register more than one watcher for the same key."

msgid "First, you register a watcher. After that, the watcher callback is invoked for the first time. In this case, the callback is triggered whether or not the key has already been broadcast. All subsequent invocations are triggered with :doc:`box.broadcast() </reference/reference_lua/box_events/broadcast>` called on the remote host. If a watcher is subscribed for a key that has not been broadcast yet, the callback is triggered only once, after the registration of the watcher."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/reference/reference_lua/box_events.rst:43
msgid "The watcher callback takes two arguments. The first argument is the name of the key for which it was registered. The second one contains current key data. The callback is always invoked in a new fiber. It means that it is allowed to yield in it. A watcher callback is never executed in parallel with itself. If the key is updated while the watcher callback is running, the callback will be invoked again with the new value as soon as it returns."
