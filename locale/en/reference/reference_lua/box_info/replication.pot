msgid "In the following, *n* is the index number of one table item, for example, :samp:`replication[1]`, which has data about server instance number 1, which may or may not be the same as the current instance (the \"current instance\" is what is responding to ``box.info``)."

msgid ":samp:`replication[{n}].upstream` appears (is not ``nil``) if the current instance is following or intending to follow instance *n*, which ordinarily means :samp:`replication[{n}].upstream.status` = ``follow``, :samp:`replication[{n}].upstream.peer` = url of instance *n* which is being followed, :samp:`replication[{n}].lag and idle` = the instance's speed, described later. Another way to say this is: :samp:`replication[{n}].upstream` will appear when :samp:`replication[{n}].upstream.peer` is not of the current instance, and is not read-only, and was specified in ``box.cfg{replication={...}}``, so it is shown in :ref:`box.cfg.replication <cfg_replication-replication>`."

msgid ":samp:`replication[{n}].downstream.vclock` may be the same as the current instance's vclock (``box.info.vclock``) because this is for all known vclock values of the cluster. A master will know what is in a replica's copy of vclock because, when the master makes a data change, it sends the change information to the replica (including the master's vector clock), and the replica replies with what is in its entire vector clock table."

msgid ":samp:`replication[{n}].downstream.lag` is the time difference between the local time at the master node, recorded when a particular transaction was written to the :ref:`write-ahead log <internals-wal>`, and the local time recorded when it receives an acknowledgment for this transaction from a replica.
