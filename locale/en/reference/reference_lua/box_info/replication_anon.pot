"The output is similar to the one produced by ``box.info.replication`` with "
"an exception that anonymous replicas are indexed by their uuid strings "
"rather than server ids, since server ids have no meaning for anonymous "
"replicas."

"Notice that when you issue a plain ``box.info.replication_anon``, the only "
"info returned is the number of anonymous replicas following the current "
"instance. In order to see the full stats, you have to call "
"``box.info.replication_anon()``. This is done to not overload the "
"``box.info`` output with excess info, since there may be lots of anonymous "
"replicas."
