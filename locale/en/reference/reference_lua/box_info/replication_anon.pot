msgid "Notice that when you issue a plain ``box.info.replication_anon``, the only info returned is the number of anonymous replicas following the current instance. In order to see the full stats, you have to call ``box.info.replication_anon()``. This is done to not overload the ``box.info`` output with excess info, since there may be lots of anonymous replicas."

msgid "Notice that anonymous replicas hide their ``lsn`` from the others, so an anonymous replica ``lsn`` will always be reported as zero, even if an anonymous replica performs some local space operations. To find out the ``lsn`` of a specific anonymous replica, you have to issue ``box.info.lsn`` on it."
