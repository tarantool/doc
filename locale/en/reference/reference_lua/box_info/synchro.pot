msgid "``owner`` (since version :doc:`2.10.0 </release/2.10.0>`) -- ID of the replica that owns the synchronous transaction queue. Once an owner instance appears, all other instances become read-only. If the ``owner`` field is ``0``, then every instance may be writable, but they can't create any synchronous transactions. To claim or reclaim the queue, use :ref:`box.ctl.promote() <box_ctl-promote>` on the instance that you want to promote. With elections enabled, an instance runs ``box.ctl.promote()`` command automatically after winning the elections. To clear the ownership, call :ref:`box.ctl.demote() <box_ctl-demote>` on the synchronous queue owner."

msgid "``term`` (since version :doc:`2.10.0 </release/2.10.0>`) -- current queue term. It contains the term of the last ``PROMOTE`` request. Usually, it is equal to :ref:`box.info.election.term <box_info_election>`. However, the queue term value may be less than the election term. It can happen when a new round of elections has started, but no instance has been promoted yet."
