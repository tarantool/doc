"There are some major problems with using Lua **nil** values in tables. For "
"example: you can't correctly assess the length of a table that is not a "
"sequence."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Example:**"

msgid ""
"tarantool> t = {0, nil, 1, 2, nil}\n"
"---\n"
"...\n"

"tarantool> t\n"

"  - 2\n"

"tarantool> #t\n"

"- 4\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The console output of ``t`` processes **nil** values in the middle and at "
"the end of the table differently. This is due to undefined behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Trying to find the length for sparse arrays in LuaJIT leads to another "
"scenario of `undefined behavior "
"<https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#3.4.6>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To avoid this problem, use Tarantool's ``box.NULL`` constant instead of "
"**nil**. ``box.NULL`` is a placeholder for a **nil** value in tables to "
"preserve a key without a value."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using box.NULL"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``box.NULL`` is a value of the cdata type representing a NULL pointer. It is"
" similar to ``msgpack.NULL``, ``json.NULL`` and ``yaml.NULL``. So it is some"
" not **nil** value, even if it is a pointer to NULL."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use ``box.NULL`` only with capitalized NULL (``box.null`` is incorrect)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Technically speaking, ``box.NULL`` equals to ``ffi.cast('void *', 0)``."

"Notice that ``t[2]`` shows the same ``null`` output in both examples. "
"However in this example ``t[2]`` and ``t[5]`` are of the cdata type, while "
"in the previous example their type was **nil**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Avoid using implicit comparisons with nullable values when using "
"``box.NULL``. Due to `Lua behavior "
"<https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.4.4>`_, returning anything "
"except **false** or **nil** from a condition expression is considered as "
"**true**. And, as it was mentioned earlier, ``box.NULL`` is a pointer by "
"design."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That is why the expression ``box.NULL`` will always be considered **true** "
"in case it is used as a condition in a comparison. This means that the code"
msgstr ""

msgid "``if box.NULL then func() end``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"will always execute the function ``func()`` (because the condition "
"``box.NULL`` will always be neither **false** nor **nil**)."

msgid "Distinction of nil and `box.NULL`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the expression ``if x == nil`` to check if the ``x`` is either a **nil**"
" or a ``box.NULL``."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By converting data to different formats (JSON, YAML, msgpack), you shall "
"expect that it is possible that **nil** in sparse arrays will be converted "
"to ``box.NULL``. And it is worth mentioning that such conversion might be "
"unexpected (for example: by sending data via :ref:`net.box <net_box-module>`"
