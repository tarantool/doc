msgid "**Warning:** If an error occurs inside ``box.once()`` when initializing a database, you can re-execute the failed ``box.once()`` block without stopping the database. The solution is to delete the ``once`` object from the system space :ref:`_schema <box_space-schema>`. Say ``box.space._schema:select{}``, find your ``once`` object there and delete it. For example, re-executing a block with ``key='hello'`` :"

These keys are global per replica set. So a simultaneous call of ``box.once()`` with the same key on two instances of the same replica set may succeed on both of them, but it'll lead to a transaction conflict."
