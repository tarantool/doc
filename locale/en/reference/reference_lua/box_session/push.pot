" used with networks that are set up with :ref:`module net.box <net_box-"

" to use our terminology for net.box), and the client has options for getting"

"an optional argument to indicate what the session is, as taken from an "

msgid ""
"The client's job is to check for such messages after it sends something to "
"the server. The major client methods -- :ref:`conn:call <net_box-call>`, "
":ref:`conn:eval <net_box-eval>`, :ref:`conn:select <conn-select>`, "
":ref:`conn:insert <conn-insert>`, :ref:`conn:replace <conn-replace>`, "
":ref:`conn:update <conn-update>`, :ref:`conn:upsert <conn-upsert>`, "
":ref:`delete <conn-delete>` -- may cause the server to send a message."

"Situation 1: when the client calls synchronously with the default "
"``{async=false}`` option. There are two optional additional options: "
":samp:`on_push={function-name}`, and :samp:`on_push_ctx={function-"
"argument}`. When the client receives an out-of-band message for the session,"
" it invokes \"function-name(function-argument)\". For example, with options "
"``{on_push=table.insert, on_push_ctx=messages}``, the client will insert "
"whatever it receives into a table named 'messages'."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Situation 2: when the client calls asynchronously with the non-default "
"``{async=true}`` option. Here ``on_push`` and ``on_push_ctx`` are not "
"allowed, but the messages can be seen by calling ``pairs()`` in a loop."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Situation 2 complication: ``pairs()`` is subject to timeout. So there is an "
"optional argument = timeout per iteration. If timeout occurs before there is"
" a new message or a final response, there is an error return. To check for "
"an error one can use the first loop parameter (if the loop starts with \"for"
" i, message in future:pairs()\" then the first loop parameter is i). If it "
"is ``box.NULL`` then the second parameter (in our example, \"message\") is "
"the error object."
