Although ``box.session.push()`` can be called at any time, in practice it is used with networks that are set up with :ref:`module net.box <net_box-module>`, and it is invoked by the server (on the \"remote database system\" to use our terminology for net.box), and the client has options for getting such messages."

msgid "an optional argument to indicate what the session is, as taken from an earlier call to :doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_session/sync`. If it is omitted, the default is the current ``box.session.sync()`` value. In Tarantool version 2.4.1, `sync` is deprecated and its use will cause a warning. In Tarantool versions after 2.4.1, its use will cause an error."

msgid "The client's job is to check for such messages after it sends something to the server.

msgstr ""

msgid "Situation 1: when the client calls synchronously with the default ``{async=false}`` option. There are two optional additional options: :samp:`on_push={function-name}`, and :samp:`on_push_ctx={function-argument}`. When the client receives an out-of-band message for the session, it invokes \"function-name(function-argument)\". For example, with options ``{on_push=table.insert, on_push_ctx=messages}``, the client will insert whatever it receives into a table named 'messages'."
msgstr ""

msgid "Situation 2: when the client calls asynchronously with the non-default ``{async=true}`` option. Here ``on_push`` and ``on_push_ctx`` are not allowed, but the messages can be seen by calling ``pairs()`` in a loop."
msgstr ""

msgid "Situation 2 complication: ``pairs()`` is subject to timeout. So there is an optional argument = timeout per iteration. If timeout occurs before there is a new message or a final response, there is an error return. To check for an error one can use the first loop parameter (if the loop starts with \"for i, message in future:pairs()\" then the first loop parameter is i). If it is ``box.NULL`` then the second parameter (in our example, \"message\") is the error object."
