"``_vindex`` is a system space that represents a virtual view. The structure "
"of its tuples is identical to that of :ref:`_index <box_space-index>`, but "
"permissions for certain tuples are limited in accordance with user "
"privileges. ``_vindex`` contains only those tuples that are accessible to "
"the current user. See :ref:`Access control <authentication>` for details "
"about user privileges."

msgid ""
"If the user has the full set of privileges (like 'admin'), the contents of "
"``_vindex`` match the contents of ``_index``. If the user has limited "
"access, ``_vindex`` contains only tuples accessible to this user."
