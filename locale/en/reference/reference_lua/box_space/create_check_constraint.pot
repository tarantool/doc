"Create a check constraint. A check constraint is a requirement that must be "
"met when a tuple is inserted or updated in a space. Check constraints "
"created with ``space_object:create_check_constraint`` have the same effect "
"as check constraints created with an SQL CHECK() clause in a :ref:`CREATE "
"TABLE statement <sql_create_table>`."
