msgid "The system space views and the system spaces that they are associated with are: |br| ``_vcollation``, a view of :ref:`_collation <box_space-collation>`, |br| ``_vfunc``, a view of :ref:`_func <box_space-func>`, |br| ``_vindex``, a view of :ref:`_index <box_space-index>`, |br| ``_vpriv``, a view of :ref:`_priv <box_space-priv>`, |br| ``_vsequence``, a view of :ref:`_sequence <box_space-sequence>`, |br| ``_vspace``, a view of :ref:`_space <box_space-space>`, |br| ``_vspace_sequence``, a view of :ref:`_space_sequence <box_space-space-sequence>`, |br| ``_vuser``, a view of :ref:`_user <box_space-user>`."

msgid "The structure of a system space view's tuples is identical to the structure of the associated space's tuples. However, the privileges for a system space view are usually different. By default, ordinary users do not have any privileges for most system spaces, but have a 'read' privilege for system space views."
msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/reference/reference_lua/box_space/system_views.rst:23
msgid "Typically this is the default situation: |br| * :ref:`The 'public' role <box_space-user>` has 'read' privilege on all system space views because that is the situation when the database is first created. |br| * All users have the 'public' role, because it is granted to them automatically during :ref:`box.schema.user.create() <box_schema-user_create>`. |br| * The system space view will contain the tuples in the associated system space, if and only if the user has a privilege for the object named in the tuple. |br| Unless administrators change the privileges, the effect is that non-administrator users cannot access the system space, but they can access the system space view, which shows only the objects that they can access."

msgid "For example, typically, the 'admin' user can do anything with ``_space`` and ``_vspace`` looks the same as ``_space``. But the 'guest' user can only read ``_vspace``, and ``_vspace`` contains fewer tuples than ``_space``. Therefore in most installations the 'guest' user should select from ``_vspace`` to get a list of spaces."

msgstr ""

#: ../../doc/reference/reference_lua/box_space/system_views.rst:41
msgid "This example shows the difference between ``_vuser`` and ``_user``. We have explained that: If the user has the full set of privileges (like 'admin'), the contents of ``_vuser`` match the contents of ``_user``. If the user has limited access, ``_vuser`` contains only tuples accessible to this user."

msgid "To see how ``_vuser`` works, :ref:`connect to a Tarantool database remotely <connecting-remotely>` via ``net.box`` and select all tuples from the ``_user`` space, both when the 'guest' user *is* and *is not* allowed to read from the database."
