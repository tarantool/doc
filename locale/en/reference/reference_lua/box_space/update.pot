"The ``update`` function supports operations on fields — assignment, "
"arithmetic (if the field is numeric), cutting and pasting fragments of a "
"field, deleting or inserting a field. Multiple operations can be combined in"
" a single update request, and in this case they are performed atomically and"
" sequentially. Each operation requires specification of a field identifier, "
"which is usually a number. When multiple operations are present, the field "
"number for each operation is assumed to be relative to the most recent state"
" of the tuple, that is, as if all previous operations in a multi-operation "
"update have already been applied. In other words, it is always safe to merge"
" multiple ``update`` invocations into a single invocation, with no change in"
" semantics."
