msgid "Tarantool strongly recommends using ``unprepare`` as soon as the immediate objective (executing a prepared statement multiple times) is done, or whenever a prepared statement expires. There is no automatic eviction policy, although automatic ``unprepare`` will happen when the session disconnects (the session's prepared statements will be removed from the prepared-statement cache)."
