msgid "If ``t`` is a tuple instance, ``t['path']`` will return the field or subset of fields that are in ``path``. ``path`` must be a well formed JSON specification. ``path`` may contain field names if the tuple has been retrieved from a space that has an associated :ref:`format <box_space-format>`."

msgid "To prevent ambiguity, Tarantool first tries to interpret the request as :doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_tuple/field_number` or :doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_tuple/field_name`. If and only if that fails, Tarantool tries to interpret the request as ``tuple_object[field-path]``."

msgid "The path must be a well formed JSON specification, but it may be preceded by '.'. The '.' is a signal that the path acts as a suffix for the tuple."
