msgid ""
"If ``t`` is a tuple instance, ``t['path']`` will return the field or subset "
"of fields that are in ``path``. ``path`` must be a well formed JSON "
"specification. ``path`` may contain field names if the tuple has been "
"retrieved from a space that has an associated :ref:`format <box_space-"
"format>`."

msgid ""
"To prevent ambiguity, Tarantool first tries to interpret the request as "
":doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_tuple/field_number` or "
":doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_tuple/field_name`. If and only if that "
"fails, Tarantool tries to interpret the request as ``tuple_object[field-"
"path]``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The path must be a well formed JSON specification, but it may be preceded by"
" '.'. The '.' is a signal that the path acts as a suffix for the tuple."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The advantage of specifying a path is that Tarantool will use it to search "
"through a tuple body and get only the tuple part, or parts, that are "
"actually necessary."

"In the following example, a tuple named ``t`` is returned from ``replace`` "
"and then only the relevant part (in this case, matching a name) of a "
"relevant field is returned. Namely: the second field, the sixth part, the "
"value following 'value='."
