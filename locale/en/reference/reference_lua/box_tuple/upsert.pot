msgid "The same as ``tuple_object:update()``, but ignores errors. In case of an error the tuple is left intact, but an error message is printed. Only client errors are ignored, such as a bad field type, or wrong field index/name. System errors, such as OOM, are not ignored and raised just like with a normal ``update()``. Note that only bad operations are ignored. All correct operations are applied."
