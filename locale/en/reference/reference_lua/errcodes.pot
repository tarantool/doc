msgid "In the current version of the binary protocol, error messages, which are normally more descriptive than error codes, are not present in server responses. The actual message may contain a file name, a detailed reason or operating system error code. All such messages, however, are logged in the error log. Below are general descriptions of some popular codes. A complete list of errors can be found in file `errcode.h <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/blob/2.1/src/box/errcode.h>`_ in the source tree."

If checking for such an obvious error had been a concern, the programmer would probably have used pcall()."
