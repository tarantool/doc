msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A **fiber** is a set of instructions which are executed with cooperative "
"multitasking. Fibers managed by the fiber module are associated with a user-"
"supplied function called the *fiber function*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A fiber has three possible states: **running**, **suspended** or **dead**. "
"When a fiber is created with :ref:`fiber.create() <fiber-create>`, it is "
"running. When a fiber is created with :ref:`fiber.new() <fiber-new>` or "
"yields control with :ref:`fiber.sleep() <fiber-sleep>`, it is suspended. "
"When a fiber ends (because the fiber function ends), it is dead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All fibers are part of the fiber registry. This registry can be searched "
"with :ref:`fiber.find() <fiber-find>` - via fiber id (fid), which is a "
"numeric identifier."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A runaway fiber can be stopped with :ref:`fiber_object.cancel <fiber_object-"
"cancel>`. However, :ref:`fiber_object.cancel <fiber_object-cancel>` is "
"advisory — it works only if the runaway fiber calls :ref:`fiber.testcancel()"
" <fiber-testcancel>` occasionally. Most ``box.*`` functions, such as "
":ref:`box.space...delete() <box_space-delete>` or :ref:`box.space...update()"
" <box_space-update>`, do call :ref:`fiber.testcancel() <fiber-testcancel>` "
"but :ref:`box.space...select{} <box_space-select>` does not. In practice, a "
"runaway fiber can only become unresponsive if it does many computations and "
"does not check whether it has been cancelled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The other potential problem comes from fibers which never get scheduled, "
"because they are not subscribed to any events, or because no relevant events"
" occur. Such morphing fibers can be killed with :ref:`fiber.kill() <fiber-"
"kill>` at any time, since :ref:`fiber.kill() <fiber-kill>` sends an "
"asynchronous wakeup event to the fiber, and :ref:`fiber.testcancel() <fiber-"
"testcancel>` is checked whenever such a wakeup event occurs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Like all Lua objects, dead fibers are garbage collected. The Lua garbage "
"collector frees pool allocator memory owned by the fiber, resets all fiber "
"data, and returns the fiber (now called a fiber carcass) to the fiber pool. "
"The carcass can be reused when another fiber is created."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A fiber has all the features of a Lua `coroutine "
"<http://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html#9>` and all the programming concepts "
"that apply for Lua coroutines will apply for fibers as well. However, "
"Tarantool has made some enhancements for fibers and has used fibers "
"internally. So, although use of coroutines is possible and supported, use of"
" fibers is recommended."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``cpu_misses`` indicates the number of times the TX thread detected it was "

"``fiber.top()`` uses the CPU timestamp counter to measure each fiber's "
"execution time. However, each CPU core may have its own counter value (you "
"can only rely on counter deltas if both measurements were taken on the same "
"core, otherwise the delta may even get negative). When the TX thread is "
"rescheduled to a different CPU core, Tarantool just assumes the CPU delta "
