msgid "Overview"

msgid "The ``http`` module, specifically the ``http.client`` submodule, provides the functionality of an HTTP client with support for HTTPS and keepalive. It uses routines in the `libcurl <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/>`_ library."

msgid "Parameters"
msgstr ""

msgid "integer settings which are passed to ``libcurl``."
msgstr ""

msgid "The two possible options are ``max_connections`` and ``max_total_connections``."
msgstr ""

msgid "``max_connections`` is the maximum number of entries in the cache. It affects ``libcurl``'s `CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS.html>`_. The default is -1."
msgstr ""

msgid "``max_total_connections`` is the maximum number of active connections. It affects ``libcurl``'s  `CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS.html>`_. It is ignored if the ``curl`` version is less than 7.30. The default is 0, which allows ``libcurl`` to scale according to easy handles count."
msgstr ""

msgid "The default option values are usually good enough but in rare cases it might be good to set them. In that case here are two tips."
msgstr ""

msgid "1. You may want to control the maximum number of sockets that a particular http client uses simultaneously. If a system passes many requests to distinct hosts, then ``libcurl`` cannot reuse sockets. In this case setting ``max_total_connections`` may be useful, since it causes ``curl`` to avoid creating too many sockets which would not be used anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "2. Do not set ``max_connections`` less than ``max_total_connections`` unless you are confident about your actions. When ``max_connections`` is less then ``max_total_connections``, in some cases ``libcurl`` will not reuse sockets for requests that are going to the same host. If the limit is reached and a new request occurs, then ``libcurl`` will first create a new socket, send the request, wait for the first connection to be free, and close it, in order to avoid exceeding the ``max_connections`` cache size. In the worst case, ``libcurl`` will create a new socket for every request, even if all requests are going to the same host. See `this Tarantool issue on github <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/3945>`_ for details."
