msgid "Overview"

msgid "The ``http`` module, specifically the ``http.client`` submodule, provides the functionality of an HTTP client with support for HTTPS and keepalive. It uses routines in the `libcurl <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/>`_ library."

msgid "integer settings which are passed to libcurl."
msgstr ""

msgid "The two possible options are ``max_connections`` and ``max_total_connections``."
msgstr ""

msgid "``max_connections`` is the maximum number of entries in the cache. It affects libcurl `CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS.html>`_. The default is -1."
msgstr ""

msgid "``max_total_connections`` is the maximum number of active connections. It affects libcurl  `CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS.html>`_. It is ignored if the curl version is less than 7.30. The default is 0, which allows libcurl to scale accordingly to easily handles count."
msgstr ""

msgid "The default option values are usually good enough but in rare cases it might be good to set them. In that case here are two tips."
msgstr ""

msgid "You may want to control the maximum number of sockets that a particular HTTP client uses simultaneously. If a system passes many requests to distinct hosts, then libcurl cannot reuse sockets. In this case setting ``max_total_connections`` may be useful, since it causes curl to avoid creating too many sockets which would not be used anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do not set ``max_connections`` less than ``max_total_connections`` unless you are confident about your actions. When ``max_connections`` is less then ``max_total_connections``, in some cases libcurl will not reuse sockets for requests that are going to the same host. If the limit is reached and a new request occurs, then libcurl will first create a new socket, send the request, wait for the first connection to be free, and close it, in order to avoid exceeding the ``max_connections`` cache size. In the worst case, libcurl will create a new socket for every request, even if all requests are going to the same host. See `this Tarantool issue on github <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/3945>`_ for details."

See also    `CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPIDLE <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPIDLE.html>`_    and the note below about keepalive_interval.  * ``keepalive_interval`` - the interval, in seconds, that the operating    system will wait between sending keepalive probes. See also    `CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPINTVL <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPINTVL.html>`_.    If both ``keepalive_idle`` and ``keepalive_interval`` are set, then    Tarantool will also set HTTP keepalive headers: ``Connection:Keep-Alive``    and ``Keep-Alive:timeout=<keepalive_idle>``.    Otherwise Tarantool will send ``Connection:close``  * ``low_speed_limit`` - set the \"low speed limit\" -- the average    transfer speed in bytes per second that the transfer should be below    during \"low speed time\" seconds for the library to consider it to be    too slow and abort. See also    `CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT.html>`_  * ``low_speed_time`` - set the \"low speed time\" -- the time that the    transfer speed should be below the \"low speed limit\" for the library    to consider it too slow and abort. See also    `CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME.html>`_  * ``max_header_name_len`` - the maximal length of a header name. If a header    name is bigger than this value, it is truncated to this length.    The default value is '32'.  * ``follow_location`` - when the option is set to ``true`` (default)    and the response has a 3xx code, the HTTP client will automatically issue    another request to a location that a server sends in the ``Location``    header. If the new response is 3xx again, the HTTP client will    issue still another request and so on in a loop until a non-3xx response    will be received. This last response will be returned as a result.    Setting this option to ``false`` allows to disable this behavior.    In this case, the HTTP client will return a 3xx response itself.  * ``no_proxy`` - a comma-separated list of hosts that do not require proxies, or '*', or ''.    Set :samp:`no_proxy = {host} [, {host} ...]` to specify    hosts that can be reached without requiring a proxy, even if ``proxy`` has    been set to a non-blank value and/or if a proxy-related environment variable    has been set.    Set ``no__proxy = '*'`` to specify that all hosts can be reached    without requiring a proxy, which is equivalent to setting ``proxy=''``.    Set ``no_proxy = ''`` to specify that no hosts can be reached    without requiring a proxy, even if a proxy-related environment variable    (HTTP_PROXY) is used.    If ``no_proxy`` is not set, then a proxy-related environment variable    (HTTP_PROXY) may be used. See also    `CURLOPT_NOPROXY <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_NOPROXY.html>`_  * ``proxy`` - a proxy server host or IP address, or ''.    If ``proxy`` is a host or IP address, then it may begin with a scheme,    for example 'https://' for an https proxy or 'http:// for an http proxy.    If ``proxy`` is set to '' an empty string, then proxy use is disabled,    and no proxy-related environment variable will be used.    If ``proxy`` is not set, then a proxy-related environment variable may be used, such as    HTTP_PROXY or HTTPS_PROXY or FTP_PROXY, or ALL_PROXY if the    protocol can be any protocol. See also    `CURLOPT_PROXY <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY.html>`_  * ``proxy_port`` -- a proxy server port.    The default is 443 for an https proxy and 1080 for a non-https proxy.    See also    `CURLOPT_PROXYPORT <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXYPORT.html>`_  * ``proxy_user_pwd`` -- a proxy server user name and/or password.    Format: :samp:`proxy_user_pwd = {user_name}:`    or :samp:`proxy_user_pwd = :{password}`    or :samp:`proxy_user_pwd = {user_name}:{password}`.

See also    `CURLOPT_SSLCERT <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSLCERT.html>`_  * ``ssl_key`` - path to a private key file for a TLS and SSL client    certificate. See also    `CURLOPT_SSLKEY <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSLKEY.html>`_  * ``timeout`` - number of seconds to wait for a curl API read request    before timing out  * ``unix_socket`` - a socket name to use instead of an Internet address,    for a local connection. The Tarantool server must be built with    ``libcurl`` 7.40 or later. See the :ref:`second example <http-example2>`    later in this section.  * ``verbose`` - set on/off verbose mode  * ``verify_host`` - set on/off verification of the certificate's name    (CN) against host. See also    `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST.html>`_  * ``verify_peer`` - set on/off verification of the peer's SSL    certificate. See also    `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER.html>`_  * ``accept_encoding`` - enables automatic decompression of HTTP responses    by setting the contents of the `Accept-Encoding: header` sent in an    HTTP request and enabling decoding of a response when the `Content-Encoding: header`    is received. This option specifies what encoding to use.    It can be an empty string which means the `Accept-Encoding: header` will    contain all supported built-in encodings. Four encodings are supported: `identity`,    meaning non-compressed, `deflate` which requests the server to compress its    response using the zlib algorithm, `gzip` which requests the gzip algorithm and `br`    which is brotli. Provide them in the string as a comma-separated list of accepted    encodings, like: ``\"br, gzip, deflate\"``.
