msgstr ""

msgid "The :code:`strict` module has functions for turning \"strict mode\" on or off. When strict mode is on, an attempt to use an undeclared global variable will cause an error. A global variable is considered \"undeclared\" if it has never had a value assigned to it. Often this is an indication of a programming error."
msgstr ""

msgid "By default strict mode is off, unless tarantool was built with the ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`` option -- see the description of build options in section :ref:`building-from-source <building_from_source>`."
