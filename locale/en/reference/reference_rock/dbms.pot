msgid "SQL DBMS Modules"
msgstr ""

msgid "The discussion here in the reference is about incorporating and using two modules that have already been created: the \"SQL DBMS rocks\" for MySQL and PostgreSQL."
msgstr ""

msgid "To call another DBMS from Tarantool, the essential requirements are: another DBMS, and Tarantool. The module which connects Tarantool to another DBMS may be called a \"connector\". Within the module there is a shared library which may be called a \"driver\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tarantool supplies DBMS connector modules with the module manager for Lua, LuaRocks. So the connector modules may be called \"rocks\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Tarantool rocks allow for connecting to SQL servers and executing SQL statements the same way that a MySQL or PostgreSQL client does. The SQL statements are visible as Lua methods. Thus Tarantool can serve as a \"MySQL Lua Connector\" or \"PostgreSQL Lua Connector\", which would be useful even if that was all Tarantool could do. But of course Tarantool is also a DBMS, so the module also is useful for any operations, such as database copying and accelerating, which work best when the application can work on both SQL and Tarantool inside the same Lua routine. The methods for connect/select/insert/etc. are similar to the ones in the :ref:`net.box <net_box-module>` module."
msgstr ""

msgid "From a user's point of view the MySQL and PostgreSQL rocks are very similar, so the following sections -- \"MySQL Example\" and \"PostgreSQL Example\" -- contain some redundancy."
msgstr ""

msgid "MySQL Example"
msgstr ""

msgid "This example assumes that MySQL 5.5 or MySQL 5.6 or MySQL 5.7 has been installed. Recent MariaDB versions will also work, the MariaDB C connector is used. The package that matters most is the MySQL client developer package, typically named something like libmysqlclient-dev. The file that matters most from this package is libmysqlclient.so or a similar name. One can use ``find`` or ``whereis`` to see what directories these files are installed in."
msgstr ""

msgid "It will be necessary to install Tarantool's MySQL driver shared library, load it, and use it to connect to a MySQL server instance. After that, one can pass any MySQL statement to the server instance and receive results, including multiple result sets."
msgstr ""

msgid "Installation"
msgstr ""

msgid "Check the instructions for `downloading and installing a binary package <http://tarantool.org/download.html>`_ that apply for the environment where Tarantool was installed. In addition to installing ``tarantool``, install ``tarantool-dev``. For example, on Ubuntu, add the line:"
msgstr ""

msgid "$ sudo apt-get install tarantool-dev"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now, for the MySQL driver shared library, there are two ways to install:"
msgstr ""

msgid "With LuaRocks"
msgstr ""

msgid "Begin by installing luarocks and making sure that tarantool is among the upstream servers, as in the instructions on `rocks.tarantool.org`_, the Tarantool luarocks page. Now execute this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "luarocks install mysql [MYSQL_LIBDIR = *path*]\n"
"                       [MYSQL_INCDIR = *path*]\n"
"                       [--local]"
msgstr ""

msgid "For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "$ luarocks install mysql MYSQL_LIBDIR=/usr/local/mysql/lib"
msgstr ""

msgid "With GitHub"
msgstr ""

msgid "Go the site `github.com/tarantool/mysql`_. Follow the instructions there, saying:"
msgstr ""

msgid "$ git clone https://github.com/tarantool/mysql.git\n"
"$ cd mysql && cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo\n"
"$ make\n"
"$ make install"
msgstr ""

msgid "At this point it is a good idea to check that the installation produced a file named ``driver.so``, and to check that this file is on a directory that is searched by the ``require`` request."
msgstr ""

msgid "Connecting"
msgstr ""

msgid "Begin by making a ``require`` request for the mysql driver. We will assume that the name is ``mysql`` in further examples."
msgstr ""

msgid "mysql = require('mysql')"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now, say:"
msgstr ""

msgid "*connection_name* = mysql.connect(*connection options*)"
msgstr ""

msgid "The connection-options parameter is a table. Possible options are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ":samp:`host = {host-name}` - string, default value = 'localhost'"
msgstr ""

msgid ":samp:`port = {port-number}` - number, default value = 3306"
msgstr ""

msgid ":samp:`user = {user-name}` - string, default value is operating-system user name"
msgstr ""

msgid ":samp:`password = {password}` - string, default value is blank"
msgstr ""

msgid ":samp:`db = {database-name}` - string, default value is blank"
msgstr ""

msgid ":samp:`raise = {true|false}` - boolean, default value is false"
msgstr ""

msgid "The option names, except for `raise`, are similar to the names that MySQL's mysql client uses, for details see the MySQL manual at `dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/connecting.html`_. The `raise` option should be set to :codenormal:`true` if errors should be raised when encountered. To connect with a Unix socket rather than with TCP, specify ``host = 'unix/'`` and :samp:`port = {socket-name}`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example, using a table literal enclosed in {braces}:"
msgstr ""

msgid "conn = mysql.connect({\n"
