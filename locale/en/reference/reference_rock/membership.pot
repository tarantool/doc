msgid "Module `membership`"
msgstr ""

msgid "This module is a ``membership`` library for Tarantool based on a gossip protocol."
msgstr ""

msgid "This library builds a mesh from multiple Tarantool instances. The mesh monitors itself, helps members discover everyone else in the group and get notified about their status changes with low latency. It is built upon the ideas from Consul or, more precisely, the SWIM algorithm."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``membership`` module works over UDP protocol and can operate even before the ``box.cfg`` initialization."
msgstr ""

msgid "Member data structure"
msgstr ""

msgid "A member is represented by the table with the following fields:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``uri`` (string) is a Uniform Resource Identifier."
msgstr ""

msgid "``status`` (string) is a string that takes one of the values below."
msgstr ""

msgid "``alive``: a member that replies to ping-messages is ``alive`` and well."
msgstr ""

msgid "``suspect``: if any member in the group cannot get a reply from any other member, the first member asks three other ``alive`` members to send a ping-message to the member in question. If there is no response, the latter becomes a ``suspect``."
msgstr ""

msgid "``dead``: a ``suspect`` becomes ``dead`` after a timeout."
msgstr ""

msgid "``left``: a member gets the ``left`` status after executing the :ref:`leave() <membership-leave>` function."
msgstr ""

msgid "The gossip protocol guarantees that every member in the group becomes aware of any status change in two communication cycles."
msgstr ""

msgid "``incarnation`` (number) is a value incremented every time the instance is becomes a ``suspect``, ``dead``, or updates its payload."
msgstr ""

msgid "``payload`` (table) is auxiliary data that can be used by various modules."
msgstr ""

msgid "``timestamp`` (number) is a value of ``fiber.time64()`` which:"
msgstr ""

msgid "corresponds to the last update of ``status`` or ``incarnation``;"
msgstr ""

msgid "is always local;"
msgstr ""

msgid "does not depend on other members' clock setting."
msgstr ""

msgid "Below is an example of the table:"
msgstr ""

msgid "tarantool> membership.myself()\n"
"---\n"
"uri: localhost:33001\n"
