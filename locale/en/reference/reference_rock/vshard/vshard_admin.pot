msgstr ""

msgid "This approach allows assigning a zero weight to a replica set, which initiates migration of its buckets to the remaining cluster nodes. It also allows adding a new zero-load replica set, which initiates migration of the buckets from the loaded replica sets to the zero-load replica set."

msgid "Parallel rebalancing"
msgstr ""

msgid "Originally, ``vshard`` had quite a simple ``rebalancer`` – one process on one node that calculated *routes* which should send buckets, how many, and to whom. The nodes applied these routes one by one sequentially."
msgstr ""

msgid "Unfortunately, such a simple schema worked not fast enough, especially for Vinyl, where costs of reading disk were comparable with network costs. In fact, with Vinyl the ``rebalancer`` routes applier was sleeping most of the time."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now each node can send multiple buckets in parallel in a round-robin manner to multiple destinations, or to just one."
msgstr ""

msgid "To set the degree of parallelism, a new option was added -- :ref:`rebalancer_max_sending <cfg_basic-rebalancer_max_sending>`. You can specify it in a storage configuration in the root table:"
msgstr ""

msgid "cfg.rebalancer_max_sending = 5\n"
"vshard.storage.cfg(cfg, box.info.uuid)"
msgstr ""

msgid "In routers, this option is ignored."
msgstr ""

msgid "Specifying ``cfg.rebalancer_max_sending = N`` probably won't give N times speed up. It depends on network, disk, number of other fibers in the system."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Example #1:**"
msgstr ""

msgid "You have 10 replica sets and a new one is added. Now all the 10 replica sets will try to send buckets to the new one."
msgstr ""

msgid "Assume that each replica set can send up to 5 buckets at once. In that case, the new replica set will experience a rather big load of 50 buckets being downloaded at once. If the node needs to do some other work, perhaps such a big load is undesirable. Also too many parallel buckets can cause timeouts in the rebalancing process itself."
msgstr ""

msgid "To fix the problem, you can set a lower value for ``rebalancer_max_sending`` for old replica sets, or decrease ``rebalancer_max_receiving`` for the new one. In the latter case some workers on old nodes will be throttled, and you will see that in the logs."
msgstr ""

msgid "``rebalancer_max_sending`` is important, if you have restrictions for the maximal number of buckets that can be read-only at once in the cluster. As you remember, when a bucket is being sent, it does not accept new write requests."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Example #2:**"
msgstr ""

msgid "You have 100000 buckets and each bucket stores ~0.001% of your data. The cluster has 10 replica sets. And you never can afford > 0.1% of data locked on write. Then you should not set ``rebalancer_max_sending`` > 10 on these nodes. It guarantees that the rebalancer won't send more than 100 buckets at once in the whole cluster."
msgstr ""

msgid "If ``max_sending`` is too high and ``max_receiving`` is too low, then some buckets will try to get relocated – and will fail with that. This problem will consume network resources and time. It is important to configure these parameters to not conflict with each other."
msgstr ""

msgid "Replica set lock and bucket pin"
msgstr ""

msgid "A replica set lock makes a replica set invisible to the ``rebalancer``: a locked replica set can neither receive new buckets nor migrate its own buckets."
msgstr ""

msgid "A bucket pin blocks a specific bucket from migrating: a pinned bucket stays on the replica set to which it is pinned, until it is unpinned."
msgstr ""

msgid "Pinning all replica set buckets is not equivalent to locking a replica set. Even if you pin all buckets, a non-locked replica set can still receive new buckets."
msgstr ""

msgid "Replica set lock is helpful, for example, to separate a replica set from production replica sets for testing, or to preserve some application metadata that must not be sharded for a while. A bucket pin is used for similar cases but in a smaller scope."
msgstr ""

msgid "By both locking a replica set and pinning all buckets, one can isolate an entire replica set."
msgstr ""

msgid "Locked replica sets and pinned buckets affect the rebalancing algorithm as the ``rebalancer`` must ignore locked replica sets and consider pinned buckets when attempting to reach the best possible balance."
msgstr ""

msgid "The issue is not trivial as a user can pin too many buckets to a replica set, so a perfect balance becomes unreachable. For example, consider the following cluster (assume all replica set weights are equal to 1)."

msgstr ""

msgid "Replica set lock and rebalancing"
msgstr ""

msgid "Locked replica sets simply do not participate in rebalancing. This means that even if the actual total number of buckets is not equal to the etalon number, the disbalance cannot be fixed due to the lock. When the rebalancer detects that one of the replica sets is locked, it recalculates the etalon number of buckets of the non-locked replica sets as if the locked replica set and its buckets did not exist at all."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bucket pin and rebalancing"
msgstr ""

msgid "Rebalancing replica sets with pinned buckets requires a more complex algorithm. Here ``pinned_count[o]`` is the number of pinned buckets, and ``etalon_count`` is the etalon number of buckets for a replica set:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``rebalancer`` calculates the etalon number of buckets as if all buckets were not pinned. Then the rebalancer checks each replica set and compares the etalon number of buckets with the number of pinned buckets in a replica set. If ``pinned_count < etalon_count``, non-locked replica sets (at this point all locked replica sets already are filtered out) with pinned buckets can receive new buckets."
msgstr ""

msgid "If ``pinned_count > etalon_count``, the disbalance cannot be fixed, as the ``rebalancer`` cannot move pinned buckets out of this replica set. In such a case the etalon number is updated and set equal to the number of pinned buckets. The replica sets with ``pinned_count > etalon_count`` are not processed by the ``rebalancer``, and the number of pinned buckets is subtracted from the total number of buckets. The rebalancer tries to move out as many buckets as possible from such replica sets."
