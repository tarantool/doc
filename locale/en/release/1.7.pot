"Layout of ``box.space._index`` has been extended to support "

":ref:`fiber_name() <fiber_object-name_get>` now raises an exception instead "

"Hybrid schema-less + schemaful data model. Earlier Tarantool versions "

"field types are automatically validated on every DML operation, and defined "

"Collation and Unicode support. By default, when Tarantool compares strings, "

"This is the first alpha in the 1.7 series. The main feature of this release "
"is a new storage engine, called \"vinyl\". Vinyl is a write optimized "
"storage engine, allowing the amount of data stored exceed the amount of "
"available RAM 10-100x times. Vinyl is a continuation of the Sophia engine "
"from 1.6, and effectively a fork and a distant relative of Dmitry "
"Simonenko's Sophia. Sophia is superseded and replaced by Vinyl. Internally "
"it is organized as a log structured merge tree. However, it takes a serious "
"effort to improve on the traditional deficiencies of log structured storage,"
" such as poor read performance and unpredictable write latency. A single "
"index is range partitioned among many LSM data structures, each having its "
"own in-memory buffers of adjustable size. Range partitioning allows merges "
"of LSM levels to be more granular, as well as to prioritize hot ranges over "
"cold ones in access to resources, such as RAM and I/O. The merge scheduler "
"is designed to minimize write latency while ensuring read performance stays "
"within acceptable limits. Vinyl today only supports a primary key index. The"
" index can consist of up to 256 parts, like in MemTX, up from 8 in Sophia. "
"Partial key reads are supported. Support of non-sequential multi part keys, "
"as well as secondary keys is on the short term todo. Our intent is to remove"
