msgid "Announcement: https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/releases/tag/2.1.2."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is the first :ref:`stable <release-policy>` release in the 2.x series."
msgstr ""

msgid "The goal of this release is to significantly extend SQL support and increase stability."
msgstr ""

msgid "Functionality added or changed:"
msgstr ""

msgid "(SQL) ``box.sql.execute()`` replaced with :ref:`box.execute() <box-sql_box_execute>`. It now works just like ``netbox.execute()``: returns result set metadata, row count, etc. E.g.:"
msgstr ""

msgid "box.execute(\"CREATE TABLE person(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, birth_year INT)\")\n"
"---\n"
"- row_count: 1\n"
"...\n"
"box.execute(\"SELECT birth_year FROM person\")\n"
"---\n"
"- metadata:\n"
"  - name: birth_year\n"
"    type: INTEGER\n"
"  rows:\n"
"  - [1983]\n"
"  - [1984]\n"
"..."
msgstr ""

msgid "(SQL) Type system was :ref:`significantly refactored <sql>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "(SQL) There are cases in SQL when it is possible to do Tarantool’s update operation for UPDATE statement, instead of doing delete + insert. However, there are cases where SQL semantics is too complex. E.g.:"
msgstr ""

msgid "CREATE TABLE file (id INT PRIMARY KEY, checksum INT);\n"
"INSERT INTO stock VALUES (1, 3),(2, 4),(3,5);\n"
"CREATE UNIQUE INDEX i ON file (checksum);\n"
"SELECT * FROM file;\n"
"-- [1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 5]\n"
"UPDATE OR REPLACE file SET checksum = checksum + 1;\n"
"SELECT * FROM stock;\n"
"-- [1, 4], [3, 6]"
msgstr ""

msgid "I.e. [1, 3] tuple is updated as [1, 4] and have replaced tuple [2, 4]. This logic is implemented by preventive tuple deletion from all corresponding indexes in SQL."
msgstr ""

msgid "(SQL) Now SQL’s integer type is stored as integer in space’s format. It was stored as scalar before, which made comparisons slow."
msgstr ""

msgid "(SQL) It is now possible to define a constraint :ref:`within column definition <sql_create_table>`. E.g.:"
msgstr ""

msgid "CREATE TABLE person (id INT PRIMARY KEY, age INT, CHECK (age > 10));"
msgstr ""

msgid "(SQL) Syntax for the pragma ``pragma index_info`` is now unified with ``table_info``. E.g. to get information on index ``age_index`` of table ``person`` you can write:"
msgstr ""

msgid "pragma index_info(person.age_index);"
msgstr ""

msgid "(Server) It is now possible to index a field specified using JSON. E.g.:"
msgstr ""

msgid "person = box.schema.create_space(\"person\")\n"
"name_idx = person:create_index('name', {parts = {{'[2]fname', 'str'}, {'[2]sname', 'str'}}})\n"
"person:insert({1, {fname='James', sname='Bond'}, {town='London', country='GB', organization='MI6'}})"
msgstr ""

msgid "(Server) In case of out of space event, Tarantool is now allowed to delete backup WAL files not needed for recovery from the last checkpoint."
msgstr ""

msgid "(Server) Add support for :ref:`tarantoolctl rocks pack / unpack <tarantoolctl-module_management>` subcommands. The subcommands are used to create / deploy binary rock distributions."
msgstr ""

msgid "(Server) ``string.rstrip`` and ``string.lstrip`` should accept symbols to strip. Add optional 'chars' parameter for specifying the unwanted characters. E.g.:"
msgstr ""

msgid "local chars = \"#\\0\"\n"
"str = \"##Hello world!#\"\n"
"print(string.strip(str, chars)) -- \"Hello world!\""
msgstr ""

msgid "(Server) :ref:`on_shutdown <box_ctl-on_shutdown>` trigger added. It may be set in a way similar to ``space:on_replace`` triggers:"
msgstr ""

msgid "box.ctl.on_shutdown(new_trigger, old_trigger)"
msgstr ""

msgid "(Server) :ref:`on_schema_init <box_ctl-on_schema_init>` trigger added. It may be set before the first call to ``box.cfg()`` and is fired during ``box.cfg()`` before user data recovery start. To set the trigger, say:"
msgstr ""

msgid "box.ctl.on_schema_init(new_trig, old_trig)"
msgstr ""

msgid "(Server) A new option for the snapshot daemon, :ref:`box.cfg.checkpoint_wal_threshold <cfg_checkpoint_daemon-checkpoint_wal_threshold>`, allows to limit the maximum disk size of maintained WALs. Once the configured threshold is exceeded, the WAL thread notifies the checkpoint daemon that it's time to make a new checkpoint and delete old WAL files."
msgstr ""

msgid "(Server) New types of :ref:`privileges <authentication-owners_privileges>` -- to create, alter and drop space -- were introduced. In order to create, drop or alter space or index, you should have a corresponding privilege. E.g.:"
msgstr ""

msgid "box.schema.user.create(\"optimizer\", { password  = 'secret' })\n"
"box.schema.user.grant(\"optimizer\", \"alter\", \"space\")\n"
"person = box.schema.space.create(\"person\")\n"
"box.session.su(\"optimizer\")\n"
"i = s:create_index(\"primary\") -- success\n"
"s:insert{1} -- fail\n"
"s:select{} -- fail\n"
"s:drop() -- fail"
msgstr ""

msgid "Notice the incompatible change: Tarantool 1.10 requires read/write/execute privileges on an object to allow create, drop or alter. These privileges are no longer sufficient in 2.1. To remedy the problem, Tarantool 2.1 automatically grants create/drop/alter privileges on an object if a user has read/write/execute privileges on it during schema upgrade. But old scripts may stop working if read/write/execute is granted **after** schema upgrade."
msgstr ""

msgid "Additionally, create/drop/alter privileges are already supported in 1.10, which also supports the old semantics of read/write/execute. You are encouraged to grant new privileges in 1.10 before upgrade and modify your scripts."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Release 2.1.1**"
msgstr ""

msgid "Release type: beta. Release date: 2018-11-14."
