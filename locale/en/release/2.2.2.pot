msgid "Overview"
msgstr ""

msgid "2.2.2 is the first stable version of the 2.2 release series. The label stable means we have all planned features implemented and we see no high-impact issues."
msgstr ""

msgid "This release resolves roughly 75 issues since the latest beta version. There may be bugs in less common areas, please feel free to file an issue at `GitHub <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues>`__."
msgstr ""

msgid "Compatibility"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tarantool 2.x is backward compatible with Tarantool 1.10.x in binary data layout, client-server protocol and replication protocol."
msgstr ""

msgid "Please `upgrade <https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/2.2/book/admin/upgrades/>`__ using the ``box.schema.upgrade()`` procedure to unlock all the new features of the 2.x series."
msgstr ""

msgid "Functionality added or changed"
msgstr ""

msgid "There are changes labeled with **[Breaking change]**. It means that the old behaviour was considered error-prone and therefore changed to protect users from unintended mistakes. However, there is a little probability that someone can lean on the old behaviour, and this label is to bring attention to the things that have been changed."

msgid "**[Breaking change]** json and msgpack serializers now raise an error"
msgstr ""

msgid "when a depth of data nesting exceeds ``encode_max_depth`` option value. The default value of the option is increased from 32 to 128. ``encode_deep_as_nil`` option was added to give ability to set the old behaviour back. gh-4434 Note: Those options can be set using ``json.cfg({<...>})`` or ``msgpack.cfg({<...>})``. Note: box data modification functions (``insert``, ``replace``, ``update``, ``upsert``) follows options of default msgpack serializer instance and now they will raise an error by default on too nested data rather then cut them silently. This behaviour can be configured using ``msgpack.cfg({<...>})``. Note: ``box.tuple.new()``, ``space:update()``, ``space:upsert()`` and several other functions did not follow ``encode_max_depth`` option, now they do (see also"
