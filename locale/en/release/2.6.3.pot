msgid "Introduced the concept of WAL queue and the new configuration option ``wal_queue_max_size``, measured in bytes. The default value is 16 Mb. The option helps limit the pace at which replica submits new transactions to the WAL. The limit is checked every time a transaction from the master is submitted to the replica’s WAL. The space taken by the transaction is considered empty once it’s successfully written (:tarantool-issue:`5536`)."
