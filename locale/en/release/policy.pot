msgid ""
"A Tarantool release is identified by three digits, for example, 2.6.2 or "
"1.10.9:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first digit stands for a MAJOR release series that introduces some "
"*major changes*. Up to now, there has been only one major release jump when "
"we delivered the 2.x release series with the SQL support."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second digit stands for a MINOR release series that is used for "
"introducing new *features*. :ref:`Backward incompatible changes <backward-"
"incompatible>` are possible between these release series."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The third digit is for PATCH releases by which we reflect how stable the "
"MINOR release series is:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``0`` meaning **alpha**"
msgstr ""

msgid "``1`` meaning **beta**"
msgstr ""

msgid "``2`` and above meaning **release** (earlier known as **stable**)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So, each MINOR release series goes through a development-maturity life cycle"
" as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Alpha**. Once a quarter, we start off with a new alpha version, such as "
"2.3.0, 2.4.0, and so on. This is not what an alpha release usually means in "
"the typical software release life cycle but rather the current trunk version"
" which is under heavy development and can be unstable. The current alpha "
"version always lives in the master branch."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Beta**. When all the features planned are implemented, we fork a new "
"branch from the master branch and tag it as a new beta version. It contains "
"``1`` for the PATCH digit, e.g., 2.3.1, 2.4.1, and so on. This version "
"cannot be called stable yet (feature freeze has just been done) although "
"there are no known critical regressions in it since the last stable release."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Release** (earlier known as **stable**). Finally, after we see our beta "
"version runs successfully in a production or development environment during "
"another quarter while we fix incoming bugs, we declare this version stable. "
"It is tagged with ``2`` for the PATCH digit, e.g., 2.3.2, 2.4.2, and so on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We support such version for 3 months while making another stable release by "
"fixing all bugs found. We release it in a quarter. This last tag contains "
"``3`` for the PATCH digit, e.g., 2.3.3, 2.4.3, and so on. After the tag is "
"set, no new changes are allowed to the release branch, and it is declared "
"deprecated and superseded by a newer MINOR version."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Release versions don't receive any new features and only get backward "
"compatible fixes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Like Ubuntu, in terms of support, we distinguish between two kinds of stable"
" release series:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**LTS (Long Term Support)** is a release series that is supported for 3 "
"years (community) and up to 5 years (paying customers). Current LTS release "
"series is 1.10, and it receives only PATCH level releases."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Standard** is a release series that is supported only for a few months "
"until the next release series enters the stable state."
msgstr ""

"Below is a diagram that illustrates the release sequence issuing described "
"above by an example of some latest releases and release series:"

"*Support* means that we continue fixing bugs. We add bug fixes "
"simultaneously into the following release series: LTS, last stable, beta, "
"and alpha. If we look at the release diagram above, it means that the bug "
"fixes are to be added into 1.10, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6 release series."

"In all supported releases, when we find and fix an outstanding "
"CVE/vulnerability, we deliver a patch for that but do not tag a new PATCH "

"A release series may introduce backward incompatible changes in a sense that"
" existing Lua, SQL or C code that are run on a current release series may "
"not be run with the same effect on a future series. However, we don't "
"exploit this rule and don't make incompatible changes without appropriate "
"reason. We usually deliver information how mature a functionality is via "
"release notes."

"Please note that binary data layout is always compatible with the previous "
"series as well as with the LTS series (an instance of ``X.Y`` version can be"
" started on top of ``X.(Y+1)`` or ``1.10.z`` data); binary protocol is "
"compatible too (client-server as well as replication protocol)."
