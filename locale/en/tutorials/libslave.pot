msgid "``libslave`` is a C++ library for reading data changes done by MysQL and, optionally, writing them to a Tarantool database. It works by acting as a replication slave. The MySQL server writes data-change information to a \"binary log\", and transfers the information to any client that says \"I want to see the information starting with this file and this record, continuously\". So, ``libslave`` is primarily good for making a Tarantool database replica (much faster than using a conventional MySQL slave server), and for keeping track of data changes so they can be searched."

msgid "We will not go into the many details here -- the `API documentation <https://github.com/vozbu/libslave/wiki/API>`_ has them. We will only show an exercise: a minimal program that uses the library."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use a test machine. Do not use a production machine."
msgstr ""

msgid "STEP 1: Make sure you have:"
msgstr ""

msgid "a recent version of Linux (versions such as Ubuntu 14.04 will not do),"
msgstr ""

msgid "a recent version of MySQL 5.6 or MySQL 5.7 server (MariaDB will not do),"
msgstr ""

msgid "MySQL client development package. For example, on Ubuntu you can download it with this command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "$ sudo apt-get install mysql-client-core-5.7"
msgstr ""

msgid "STEP 2: Download ``libslave``."
msgstr ""

msgid "The recommended source is https://github.com/tarantool/libslave/. Downloads include the source code only."
msgstr ""

msgid "$ sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev\n"

"$ cd tarantool-libslave\n"
"$ git submodule init\n"
"$ git submodule update\n"
"$ cmake .\n"
"$ make"

msgid "If you see an error message mentioning the word \"vector\", edit ``field.h`` and add this line:"
msgstr ""

msgid "#include <vector>"
msgstr ""

msgid "STEP 3: Start the MySQL server. On the command line, add appropriate switches for doing replication. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "$ mysqld --log-bin=mysql-bin --server-id=1"
msgstr ""

msgid "STEP 4: For purposes of this exercise, we are assuming you have:"
msgstr ""

msgid "a \"root\" user with password \"root\" with privileges,"
msgstr ""

msgid "a \"test\" database with a table named \"test\","
msgstr ""

msgid "a binary log named \"mysql-bin\","
msgstr ""

msgid "a server with server id = 1."
msgstr ""

msgid "The values are hard-coded in the program, though of course you can change the program -- it's easy to see their settings."
msgstr ""

msgid "STEP 5: Look at the program:"

msgid "Everything unnecessary has been stripped so that you can see quickly how it works. At the start of ``main()``, there are some settings used for connecting -- host, port, user, password. Then there is an initialization call with the binary log file name = \"mysql-bin\". Pay particular attention to the ``setCallback`` statement, which passes database name = \"test\", table name = \"test\", and callback function address = callback. The program will be looping and invoking this callback function. See how, earlier in the program, the callback function prints \"UPDATE\" or \"DELETE\" or \"INSERT\" depending on what is passed to it."
