"Tarantool has an append-only storage architecture: it appends data to "
"files but it never overwrites earlier data. The :ref:`Tarantool garbage "
"collector <cfg_checkpoint_daemon-garbage-collector>` removes old files "
"after a checkpoint. You can prevent or delay the garbage collector's "
"action by configuring the :ref:`checkpoint daemon "
"<book_cfg_checkpoint_daemon>`. Backups can be taken at any time, with "
"minimal overhead on database performance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Two functions are helpful for backups in certain situations:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`box.backup.start() <reference_lua-box_backup-backup_start>` informs"
" the server that activities related to the removal of outdated backups "
"must be suspended and returns a table with the names of snapshot and "
"vinyl files that should be copied."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`box.backup.stop() <reference_lua-box_backup-backup_stop>` later "
"informs the server that normal operations may resume."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hot backup (memtx)"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is a special case when there are only in-memory tables."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The last :ref:`snapshot file <index-box_persistence>` is a backup of the "
"entire database; and the :ref:`WAL <internals-wal>` files that are made "
"after the last snapshot are incremental backups. Therefore taking a "
"backup is a matter of copying the snapshot and WAL files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use ``tar`` to make a (possibly compressed) copy of the latest .snap and "
".xlog files on the :ref:`memtx_dir <cfg_basic-memtx_dir>` and "
":ref:`wal_dir <cfg_basic-wal_dir>` directories."
msgstr ""

msgid "If there is a security policy, encrypt the .tar file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Copy the .tar file to a safe place."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Later, restoring the database is a matter of taking the .tar file and "
"putting its contents back in the ``memtx_dir`` and ``wal_dir`` "
"directories."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hot backup (vinyl/memtx)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Vinyl stores its files in :ref:`vinyl_dir <cfg_basic-vinyl_dir>`, and "
"creates a folder for each database space. Dump and compaction processes "
"are append-only and create new files. The Tarantool garbage collector may"
" remove old files after each checkpoint."
msgstr ""

msgid "To take a mixed backup:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Issue :ref:`box.backup.start() <reference_lua-box_backup-backup_start>` "
"on the :ref:`administrative console <admin-security>`. This will return a"
" list of files to back up and suspend garbage collection for them till "
"the next ``box.backup.stop()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Copy the files from the list to a safe location. This will include memtx "
"snapshot files, vinyl run and index files, at a state consistent with the"
" last checkpoint."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Issue ``box.backup.stop()`` so the garbage collector can continue as "
"usual."
msgstr ""

msgid "Continuous remote backup (memtx)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :ref:`replication <replication>` feature is useful for backup as well"
" as for load balancing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Therefore taking a backup is a matter of ensuring that any given replica "
"is up to date, and doing a cold backup on it. Since all the other "
"replicas continue to operate, this is not a cold backup from the end "
"user’s point of view. This could be done on a regular basis, with a "
"``cron`` job or with a Tarantool fiber."
msgstr ""

msgid "Continuous backup (memtx)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The logged changes done since the last cold backup must be secured, while"
" the system is running."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For this purpose, you need a file copy utility that will do the copying "
"remotely and continuously, copying only the parts of a write ahead log "
"file that are changing. One such utility is `rsync "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, you need an ordinary file copy utility, but there should "
"be frequent production of new snapshot files or new WAL files as changes "
"occur, so that only the new files need to be copied."
