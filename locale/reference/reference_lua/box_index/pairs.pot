msgid "To understand consistency of tuples returned by an iterator, it's essential to know the principles of the Tarantool transaction processing subsystem. An iterator in Tarantool does not own a consistent read view. Instead, each procedure is granted exclusive access to all tuples and spaces until there is a \"context switch\": which may happen due to :ref:`the implicit yield rules <atomic-implicit-yields>`, or by an explicit call to :ref:`fiber.yield <fiber-yield>`. When the execution flow returns to the yielded procedure, the data set could have changed significantly. Iteration, resumed after a yield point, does not preserve the read view, but continues with the new content of the database. The tutorial :ref:`Indexed pattern search <c_lua_tutorial-indexed_pattern_search>` shows one way that iterators and yields can be used together."

A search key may contain nil (but not msgpack.NULL, which is the wrong type). An index key may not contain nil or msgpack.NULL, although a later version of Tarantool will have different rules --  the behavior of searches with nil is subject to change. Possible iterators are LT, LE, EQ, REQ, GE, GT. A search key is said to \"match\" an index key if the following statements, which are pseudocode for the comparison operation, return TRUE."
