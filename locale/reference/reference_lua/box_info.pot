Another way to say this is: :samp:`replication[{n}].upstream` will appear when :samp:`replication[{n}].upstream.peer` is not of the current instance, and is not read-only, and was specified in ``box.cfg{replication={...}}``, so it is shown in :ref:`box.cfg.replication <cfg_replication-replication>`."

msgstr ""

msgid ":samp:`replication[{n}].downstream.vclock` may be the same as the current instance's vclock (``box.info.vclock``) because this is for all known vclock values of the cluster. A master will know what is in a replica's copy of vclock because, when the master makes a data change, it sends the change information to the replica (including the master's vector clock), and the replica replies with what is in its entire vector clock table."
