msgstr ""

msgid "The ``box.info`` submodule provides access to information about server instance variables."
msgstr ""

msgid "**cluster.uuid** is the UUID of the replica set. Every instance in a replica set will have the same ``cluster.uuid`` value. This value is also stored in :ref:`box.space._schema <box_space-schema>` system space."
msgstr ""

msgid "**gc()** returns the state of the :ref:`Tarantool garbage collector <cfg_checkpoint_daemon-garbage-collector>` including the checkpoints and their consumers (users); see details :ref:`below <box_info_gc>`."

msgstr ""

msgid "**memory()** returns the statistics about memory (see :ref:`below <box_info_memory>`)."

msgid "**pid** is the process ID. This value is also shown by :ref:`tarantool <tarantool-build>` module and by the Linux command ``ps -A``."
msgstr ""

msgid "**ro** is ``true`` if the instance is in \"read-only\" mode (same as :ref:`read_only <cfg_basic-read_only>` in ``box.cfg{}``), or if status is 'orphan'."
msgstr ""

msgid "**signature** is the sum of all **lsn** values from the vector clocks (**vclock**) of all instances in the replica set."
msgstr ""

msgid "**sql().cache.size** is the number of bytes in the SQL prepared statement cache."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "**uuid** corresponds to **replication.uuid** (see :ref:`below <box_info_replication>`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "**vclock** corresponds to **replication.downstream.vclock** (see :ref:`below <box_info_replication>`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "**version** is the Tarantool version. This value is also shown by :ref:`tarantool -V <index-tarantool_version>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "**vinyl()** returns runtime statistics for the vinyl storage engine. This function is deprecated, use :ref:`box.stat.vinyl() <box_introspection-box_stat_vinyl>` instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "The **memory** function of ``box.info`` gives the ``admin`` user a picture of the whole Tarantool instance."
msgstr ""

msgid "To get a picture of the vinyl subsystem, use :ref:`box.stat.vinyl() <box_introspection-box_stat_vinyl>` instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "**memory().cache** -- number of bytes used for caching user data. The memtx storage engine does not require a cache, so in fact this is the number of bytes in the cache for the tuples stored for the vinyl storage engine."
msgstr ""

msgid "**memory().data** -- number of bytes used for storing user data (the tuples) with the memtx engine and with level 0 of the vinyl engine, without taking memory fragmentation into account."
msgstr ""

msgid "**memory().index** -- number of bytes used for indexing user data, including memtx and vinyl memory tree extents, the vinyl page index, and the vinyl bloom filters."
msgstr ""

msgid "**memory().lua** -- number of bytes used for Lua runtime."
msgstr ""

msgid "**memory().net** -- number of bytes used for network input/output buffers."
msgstr ""

msgid "**memory().tx** -- number of bytes in use by active transactions. For the vinyl storage engine, this is the total size of all allocated objects (struct ``txv``, struct ``vy_tx``, struct ``vy_read_interval``) and tuples pinned for those objects."
msgstr ""

msgid "An example with a minimum allocation while only the memtx storage engine is in use:"

msgid "The **gc** function of ``box.info`` gives the ``admin`` user a picture of the factors that affect the :ref:`Tarantool garbage collector <cfg_checkpoint_daemon-garbage-collector>`. The garbage collector compares vclock (:ref:`vector clock <replication-vector>`) values of users and checkpoints, so a look at ``box.info.gc()`` may show why the garbage collector has not removed old WAL files, or show what it may soon remove."
