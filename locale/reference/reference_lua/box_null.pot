msgid "Constant `box.NULL`"
msgstr ""

msgid "There are some major problems with using a Lua **nil** value in tuples. For example: you can't correctly assess length of sparse array (an array with nullable values set to null) in case of using Lua **nil** value."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Example:**"

msgid "To overcome this and some other issues use ``box.NULL`` constant instead."

msgid "Using box.NULL"
msgstr ""

msgid "``box.NULL`` is a generic pointer to a C-like NULL. So it there is some not **nil** value, even if it is a pointer to NULL."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use ``box.NULL`` only with capitalized NULL (``box.null`` is incorrect)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Technically speaking ``box.NULL`` equals to ``ffi.cast('void *', nil)``."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "There is a possible problem induced by using ``box.NULL``. Avoid using implicit comparisons with nullable values when using ``box.NULL``. Due to `Lua behaviour <https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.4.4>`_ returning from condition expression anything except **false** or **nil** is considered as **true**. And as it was mentioned earlier ``box.NULL`` is a pointer by design."
msgstr ""

msgid "That is why expression ``box.NULL`` will always be considered true in case it is used as condition in comparison. That means function"
msgstr ""

msgid "``if box.NULL then func() end``"
msgstr ""

msgid "will always execute function ``func()`` (as condition box.NULL is always not **false** nor **nil**)."
