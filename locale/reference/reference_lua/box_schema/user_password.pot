msgid "Return a hash of a user's password. For explanation of how Tarantool maintains passwords, see section :ref:`Passwords <authentication-passwords>` and reference on :ref:`_user <box_space-user>` space."
msgstr ""

msgid "If a non-'guest' user has no password, it’s **impossible** to connect to Tarantool using this user. The user is regarded as “internal” only, not usable from a remote connection. Such users can be useful if they have defined some procedures with the :doc:`SETUID </reference/reference_lua/box_schema/func_create>` option, on which privileges are granted to externally-connectable users. This way, external users cannot create/drop objects, they can only invoke procedures."
msgstr ""

msgid "For the 'guest' user, it’s impossible to set a password: that would be misleading, since 'guest' is the default user on a newly-established connection over a :ref:`binary port <admin-security>`, and Tarantool does not require a password to establish a :ref:`binary connection <box_protocol-iproto_protocol>`. It is, however, possible to change the current user to ‘guest’ by providing the :ref:`AUTH packet <box_protocol-authentication>` with no password at all or an empty password. This feature is useful for connection pools, which want to reuse a connection for a different user without re-establishing it."
