msgstr ""

msgid "``_vpriv`` is a system space that represents a virtual view. The structure of its tuples is identical to that of :ref:`_priv <box_space-priv>`, but permissions for certain tuples are limited in accordance with user privileges. ``_vpriv`` contains only those tuples that are accessible to the current user. See :ref:`Access control <authentication>` for details about user privileges."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the user has the full set of privileges (like 'admin'), the contents of ``_vpriv`` match the contents of ``_priv``. If the user has limited access, ``_vpriv`` contains only tuples accessible to this user."

msgid "``_vpriv`` is a system view, so it allows only read requests."

msgid "While the ``_priv`` space requires proper access privileges, any user can always read from ``_vpriv``."
