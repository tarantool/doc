msgid "``_vspace`` is a system space that represents a virtual view. The structure of its tuples is identical to that of :ref:`_space <box_space-space>`, but permissions for certain tuples are limited in accordance with user privileges. ``_vspace`` contains only those tuples that are accessible to the current user. See :ref:`Access control <authentication>` for details about user privileges."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the user has the full set of privileges (like 'admin'), the contents of ``_vspace`` match the contents of ``_space``. If the user has limited access, ``_vspace`` contains only tuples accessible to this user."
