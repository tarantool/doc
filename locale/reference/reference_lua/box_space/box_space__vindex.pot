msgstr ""

msgid "``_vindex`` is a system space that represents a virtual view. The structure of its tuples is identical to that of :ref:`_index <box_space-index>`, but permissions for certain tuples are limited in accordance with user privileges. ``_vindex`` contains only those tuples that are accessible to the current user. See :ref:`Access control <authentication>` for details about user privileges."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the user has the full set of privileges (like 'admin'), the contents of ``_vindex`` match the contents of ``_index``. If the user has limited access, ``_vindex`` contains only tuples accessible to this user."

msgid "``_vindex`` is a system view, so it allows only read requests."

msgid "While the ``_index`` space requires proper access privileges, any user can always read from ``_vindex``."
