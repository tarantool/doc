msgid "Update a tuple."

msgid "The ``update`` function supports operations on fields — assignment, arithmetic (if the field is numeric), cutting and pasting fragments of a field, deleting or inserting a field. Multiple operations can be combined in a single update request, and in this case they are performed atomically and sequentially. Each operation requires specification of a field number. When multiple operations are present, the field number for each operation is assumed to be relative to the most recent state of the tuple, that is, as if all previous operations in a multi-operation update have already been applied. In other words, it is always safe to merge multiple ``update`` invocations into a single invocation, with no change in semantics."

The fourth argument is ``2`` because the change will occur in ``field[2]``. The fifth argument is 2 because deletion will begin with the second byte. The sixth argument is 1 because the number of bytes to delete is 1. The seventh argument is ``'!!'``, because ``'!!'`` is to be added at this position.
