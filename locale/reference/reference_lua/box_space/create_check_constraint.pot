msgid "Create a check constraint. A check constraint is a requirement that must be met when a tuple is inserted or updated in a space. Check constraints created with ``space_object:create_check_constraint`` have the same effect as check constraints created with an SQL CHECK() clause in a :ref:`CREATE TABLE statement <sql_create_table>`."

msgid "The expression must return true or false and should be deterministic.

msgid "Check constraints are checked before the request is performed, at the same time as Lua :doc:`before_replace triggers </reference/reference_lua/box_space/before_replace>`. If there is more than one check constraint or before_replace trigger, then they are ordered according to time of creation.

msgid "Check constraints can be disabled with :samp:`{space_object}.ck_constraint.{check_constraint_name}:enable(false)` or :samp:`{check_constraint_object}:enable(false)`. Check constraints can be enabled with :samp:`{space_object}.ck_constraint.{check_constraint_name}:enable(true)` or :samp:`{check_constraint_object}:enable(true)`. By default a check constraint is 'enabled' which means that the check is performed whenever the request is performed, but can be changed to 'disabled' which means that the check is not performed."
