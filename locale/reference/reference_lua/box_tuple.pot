msgid "The ``box.tuple`` submodule provides read-only access for the ``tuple`` userdata type. It allows, for a single :ref:`tuple <index-box_tuple>`: selective retrieval of the field contents, retrieval of information about size, iteration over all the fields, and conversion to a `Lua table <https://www.lua.org/pil/2.5.html>`_."
