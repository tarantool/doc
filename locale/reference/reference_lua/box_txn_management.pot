msgid "Rule #1"
msgstr ""

msgid "The requests in a transaction must be sent to a server as a single block. It is not enough to enclose them between begin and commit or rollback. To ensure they are sent as a single block: put them in a function, or put them all on one line, or use a delimiter so that multi-line requests are handled together."
msgstr ""

msgid "Rule #2"
msgstr ""

msgid "All database operations in a transaction should use the same storage engine. It is not safe to access tuple sets that are defined with ``{engine='vinyl'}`` and also access tuple sets that are defined with ``{engine='memtx'}``, in the same transaction."
msgstr ""

msgid "Rule #3"
msgstr ""

msgid "Requests which cause changes to the data definition -- create, alter, drop, truncate -- are only allowed with Tarantool version 2.1 or later. Data-definition requests which change an index or change a format, such as :ref:`space_object:create_index() <box_schema-sequence_create_index>` and :ref:`space_object:format() <box_space-format>`, are not allowed inside transactions except as the first request after ``box.begin()``."
