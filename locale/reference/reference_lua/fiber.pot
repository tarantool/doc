msgid "Fibers"
msgstr ""

msgid "A **fiber** is a set of instructions which are executed with cooperative multitasking. Fibers managed by the fiber module are associated with a user-supplied function called the *fiber function*."
msgstr ""

msgid "A fiber has three possible states: **running**, **suspended** or **dead**. When a fiber is created with :ref:`fiber.create() <fiber-create>`, it is running. When a fiber is created with :ref:`fiber.new() <fiber-new>` or yields control with :ref:`fiber.sleep() <fiber-sleep>`, it is suspended. When a fiber ends (because the fiber function ends), it is dead."
msgstr ""

msgid "All fibers are part of the fiber registry. This registry can be searched with :ref:`fiber.find() <fiber-find>` - via fiber id (fid), which is a numeric identifier."
msgstr ""

msgid "A runaway fiber can be stopped with :ref:`fiber_object.cancel <fiber_object-cancel>`. However, :ref:`fiber_object.cancel <fiber_object-cancel>` is advisory — it works only if the runaway fiber calls :ref:`fiber.testcancel() <fiber-testcancel>` occasionally. Most ``box.*`` functions, such as :ref:`box.space...delete() <box_space-delete>` or :ref:`box.space...update() <box_space-update>`, do call :ref:`fiber.testcancel() <fiber-testcancel>` but :ref:`box.space...select{} <box_space-select>` does not. In practice, a runaway fiber can only become unresponsive if it does many computations and does not check whether it has been cancelled."
msgstr ""

msgid "The other potential problem comes from fibers which never get scheduled, because they are not subscribed to any events, or because no relevant events occur. Such morphing fibers can be killed with :ref:`fiber.kill() <fiber-kill>` at any time, since :ref:`fiber.kill() <fiber-kill>` sends an asynchronous wakeup event to the fiber, and :ref:`fiber.testcancel() <fiber-testcancel>` is checked whenever such a wakeup event occurs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Like all Lua objects, dead fibers are garbage collected. The Lua garbage collector frees pool allocator memory owned by the fiber, resets all fiber data, and returns the fiber (now called a fiber carcass) to the fiber pool. The carcass can be reused when another fiber is created."
msgstr ""

msgid "A fiber has all the features of a Lua coroutine_ and all the programming concepts that apply for Lua coroutines will apply for fibers as well. However, Tarantool has made some enhancements for fibers and has used fibers internally. So, although use of coroutines is possible and supported, use of fibers is recommended."
