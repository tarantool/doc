msgid "Overview"
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``net.box`` module contains connectors to remote database systems. One variant, to be discussed later, is for connecting to MySQL or MariaDB or PostgreSQL (see :ref:`SQL DBMS modules <dbms_modules>` reference). The other variant, which is discussed in this section, is for connecting to Tarantool server instances via a network."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can call the following methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``require('net.box')`` to get a ``net.box`` object (named ``net_box`` for examples in this section),"
msgstr ""

msgid "``net_box.connect()`` to connect and get a connection object (named ``conn`` for examples in this section),"
msgstr ""

msgid "other ``net.box()`` routines, passing ``conn:``, to execute requests on the remote database system,"
msgstr ""

msgid "``conn:close`` to disconnect."
msgstr ""

msgid "All ``net.box`` methods are fiber-safe, that is, it is safe to share and use the same connection object across multiple concurrent fibers. In fact that is perhaps the best programming practice with Tarantool. When multiple fibers use the same connection, all requests are pipelined through the same network socket, but each fiber gets back a correct response. Reducing the number of active sockets lowers the overhead of system calls and increases the overall server performance. However for some cases a single connection is not enough â€”- for example, when it is necessary to prioritize requests or to use different authentication IDs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Most ``net.box`` methods allow a final ``{options}`` argument, which can be:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``{timeout=...}``. For example, a method whose final argument is ``{timeout=1.5}`` will stop after 1.5 seconds on the local node, although this does not guarantee that execution will stop on the remote server node."
msgstr ""

msgid "``{buffer=...}``. For an example see :ref:`buffer module <buffer-module>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "``{is_async=...}``. For example, a method whose final argument is ``{is_async=true}`` will not wait for the result of a request. See the :ref:`is_async <net_box-is_async>` description."
msgstr ""

msgid "``{on_push=... on_push_ctx=...}``. For receiving out-of-band messages. See the :doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_session/push` description."
msgstr ""

msgid "The diagram below shows possible connection states and transitions:"
msgstr ""

msgid "On this diagram:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The state machine starts in the 'initial' state."
msgstr ""

msgid "``net_box.connect()`` method changes the state to 'connecting' and spawns a worker fiber."
msgstr ""

msgid "If authentication and schema upload are required, it's possible later on to re-enter the 'fetch_schema' state from 'active' if a request fails due to a schema version mismatch error, so schema reload is triggered."
msgstr ""

msgid "``conn.close()`` method sets the state to 'closed' and kills the worker. If the transport is already in the 'error' state, ``close()`` does nothing."

msgid "Possible options:"
msgstr ""

msgid "`user/password`: you have two ways to connect to a remote host: using :ref:`URI <index-uri>` or using the options `user` and `password`. For example, instead of ``connect('username:userpassword@localhost:33301')`` you can write ``connect('localhost:33301', {user = 'username', password='userpassword'})``."
msgstr ""

msgid "`wait_connected`: by default, connection creation is blocked until the connection is established, but passing ``wait_connected=false`` makes it return immediately. Also, passing a timeout makes it wait before returning (e.g. ``wait_connected=1.5`` makes it wait at most 1.5 seconds)."
msgstr ""

msgid "If ``reconnect_after`` is greater than zero, then ``wait_connected`` ignores transient failures. The wait completes once the connection is established or is closed explicitly."
msgstr ""

msgid "`reconnect_after`: if ``reconnect_after`` is greater than zero, then a ``net.box`` instance will try to reconnect if a connection is broken or if a connection attempt fails. This makes transient network failures become transparent to the application. Reconnect happens automatically in the background, so requests that initially fail due to connectivity loss are transparently retried. The number of retries is unlimited, connection attempts are made after each specified interval (for example ``reconnect_after=5`` means try to reconnect every 5 seconds). When a connection is explicitly closed, or when the Lua garbage collector removes it, then reconnect attempts stop. The default value of ``reconnect_after``, as with other ``connect`` options, is ``nil``."
msgstr ""

msgid "`call_16`: [since 1.7.2] by default, ``net.box`` connections comply with a new binary protocol command for CALL, which is not backward compatible with previous versions. The new CALL no longer restricts a function to returning an array of tuples and allows returning an arbitrary MsgPack/JSON result, including scalars, nil and void (nothing). The old CALL is left intact for backward compatibility. It will be removed in the next major release. All programming language drivers will be gradually changed to use the new CALL. To connect to a Tarantool instance that uses the old CALL, specify ``call_16=true``."
msgstr ""

msgid "`console`: depending on the option's value, the connection supports different methods (as if instances of different classes were returned). With ``console = true``, you can use ``conn`` methods ``close()``, ``is_connected()``, ``wait_state()``, ``eval()`` (in this case, both binary and Lua console network protocols are supported). With ``console = false`` (default), you can also use ``conn`` database methods (in this case, only the binary protocol is supported). Deprecation notice: ``console = true`` is deprecated, users should use :ref:`console.connect() <console-connect>` instead."
