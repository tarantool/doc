msgid "Convert a string or a Lua number to a 64-bit integer. The input value can be expressed in decimal, binary (for example 0b1010), or hexadecimal (for example -0xffff). The result can be used in arithmetic, and the arithmetic will be 64-bit integer arithmetic rather than floating-point arithmetic. (Operations on an unconverted Lua number use floating-point arithmetic.) The ``tonumber64()`` function is added by Tarantool; the name is global."

msgid "**Warning:** There is an underlying LuaJIT library that operates with C rules. Therefore you should expect odd results if you compare unsigned and signed (for example 0ULL > -1LL is false), or if you use numbers outside the 64-bit integer range (for example 9223372036854775808LL is negative). Also you should be aware that :samp:`type({number-literal-ending-in-ULL})` and :samp:`type(tonumber64({number-with-more-than-14-digits}))` is cdata, not a Lua arithmetic type, which prevents direct use with some functions in Lua libraries such as `math <https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#5.6>`_. See the `LuaJit reference <http://luajit.org/ext_ffi_semantics.html>`_ and look for the phrase \"64 bit integer arithmetic\". and the phrase \"64 bit integer comparison\". Or see the comments on `Issue#4089 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/4089>`_."
