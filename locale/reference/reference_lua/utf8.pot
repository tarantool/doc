msgid "Overview"
msgstr ""

msgid "``utf8`` is Tarantool's module for handling UTF-8 strings. It includes some functions which are compatible with ones in `Lua 5.3 <https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#6.5>`_ but Tarantool has much more. For example, because internally Tarantool contains a complete copy of the \"International Components For Unicode\" library, there are comparison functions which understand the default ordering for Cyrillic (Capital Letter Zhe Ж = Small Letter Zhe ж) and Japanese (Hiragana A = Katakana A)."

msgid "Compare two strings with the Default Unicode Collation Element Table (DUCET) for the `Unicode Collation Algorithm <http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/10.0.0/allkeys.txt>`_. Thus 'å' is less than 'B', even though the code-point value of å (229) is greater than the code-point value of B (66), because the algorithm depends on the values in the Collation Element Table, not the code-point values."
msgstr ""

msgid "The comparison is done with primary weights. Therefore the elements which affect secondary or later weights (such as \"case\" in Latin or Cyrillic alphabets, or \"kana differentiation\" in Japanese) are ignored. If asked \"is this like a Microsoft case-insensitive accent-insensitive collation\" we tend to answer \"yes\", though the Unicode Collation Algorithm is far more sophisticated than those terms imply."

msgid "The code-point number is the value that corresponds to a character in the `Unicode Character Database <http://www.unicode.org/Public/5.2.0/ucd/UnicodeData.txt>`_ This is not the same as the byte values of the encoded character, because the UTF-8 encoding scheme is more complex than a simple copy of the code-point number."
msgstr ""

msgid "Another way to construct a string with Unicode characters is with the \\\\u{hex-digits} escape mechanism, for example '\\\\u{41}\\\\u{42}' and ``utf8.char(65,66)`` both produce the string 'AB'."
