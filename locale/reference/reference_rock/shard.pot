msgid "Module `shard`"
msgstr ""

msgid "With sharding, the tuples of a tuple set are distributed to multiple nodes, with a Tarantool database server instance on each node. With this arrangement, each instance is handling only a subset of the total data, so larger loads can be handled by simply adding more computers to a network."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Tarantool `shard` module has facilities for creating shards, as well as analogues for the data-manipulation functions of the box library (select, insert, replace, update, delete)."
msgstr ""

msgid "First some terminology:"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Consistent hash**"
msgstr ""

msgid "The `shard` module distributes according to a hash algorithm, that is, it applies a hash function to a tuple's primary-key value in order to decide which shard the tuple belongs to. The hash function is `consistent <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing>`_ so that changing the number of servers will not affect results for many keys. The specific hash function that the `shard` module uses is :ref:`digest.guava <digest-guava>` in the :codeitalic:`digest` module."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Instance**"
msgstr ""

msgid "A currently-running in-memory copy of the Tarantool server, sometimes called a \"server instance\". Usually each shard is associated with one instance, or, if both sharding and replicating are going on, each shard is associated with one replica set."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Queue**"
msgstr ""

msgid "A temporary list of recent update requests. Sometimes called \"batching\". Since updates to a sharded database can be slow, it may speed up throughput to send requests to a queue rather than wait for the update to finish on every node. The `shard` module has functions for adding requests to the queue, which it will process without further intervention. Queuing is optional."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Redundancy**"
msgstr ""

msgid "The number of replicated data copies in each shard."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Replica**"
msgstr ""

msgid "An instance which is part of a replica set."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Replica set**"
msgstr ""

msgid "Often a single shard is associated with a single instance; however, often the shard is replicated. When a shard is replicated, the multiple instances (\"replicas\"), which handle the shard's replicated data, are a \"replica set\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Replicated data**"
msgstr ""

msgid "A complete copy of the data. The `shard` module handles both sharding and replication. One shard can contain one or more replicated data copies. When a write occurs, the write is attempted on every replicated data copy in turn. The `shard` module does not use the built-in replication feature."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Shard**"
msgstr ""

msgid "A subset of the tuples in the database partitioned according to the value returned by the consistent hash function. Usually each shard is on a separate node, or a separate set of nodes (for example if redundancy = 3 then the shard will be on three nodes)."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Zone**"
msgstr ""

msgid "A physical location where the nodes are closely connected, with the same security and backup and access points. The simplest example of a zone is a single computer with a single Tarantool-server instance. A shard's replicated data copies should be in different zones."
msgstr ""

msgid "The `shard` package is distributed separately from the main `tarantool` package. To acquire it, do a separate installation:"
msgstr ""

msgid "with Tarantool 1.7.4+, say:"
msgstr ""

msgid "$ tarantoolctl rocks install shard"
msgstr ""

msgid "install with `yum` or `apt`, for example on Ubuntu say:"
msgstr ""

msgid "$ sudo apt-get install tarantool-shard"
msgstr ""

msgid "or download from GitHub `tarantool/shard` and use the Lua files as described in the `README <https://github.com/tarantool/shard>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "Then, before using the module, say ``shard = require('shard')``."
msgstr ""

msgid "The most important function is:"
msgstr ""

msgid "shard.init(*shard-configuration*)"
msgstr ""

msgid "This must be called for every shard."
msgstr ""

msgid "The shard configuration is a table with these fields:"
msgstr ""

msgid "`servers` (a list of URIs of nodes and the zones the nodes are in)"
msgstr ""

msgid "`login` (the user name which applies for accessing via the `shard` module)"
msgstr ""

msgid "`password` (the password for the login)"
msgstr ""

msgid "`redundancy` (a number, minimum 1)"
msgstr ""

msgid "`binary` (a port number that this host is listening on, on the current host, (distinguishable from the 'listen' port specified by `box.cfg`)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Possible errors:"
msgstr ""

msgid "redundancy should not be greater than the number of servers;"
msgstr ""

msgid "the servers must be alive;"
msgstr ""

msgid "two replicated data copies of the same shard should not be in the same zone."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example: `shard.init` syntax for one shard"
msgstr ""

msgid "The number of replicated data copies per shard (redundancy) is 3."
msgstr ""

msgid "The number of instances is 3."
msgstr ""

msgid "The `shard` module will conclude that there is only one shard."
