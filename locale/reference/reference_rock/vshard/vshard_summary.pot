msgid "Scaling databases in a growing project is often considered one of the most challenging issues. Once a single server cannot withstand the load, scaling methods should be applied."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Sharding** is a database architecture that allows for `horizontal scaling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Horizontal_and_vertical_scaling>`_, which implies that a dataset is partitioned and distributed over multiple servers."
msgstr ""

msgid "With ``vshard``, the tuples of a dataset are distributed across multiple nodes, with a Tarantool database server instance on each node. Each instance handles only a subset of the total data, so larger loads can be handled by simply adding more servers. The initial dataset is partitioned into multiple parts, so each part is stored on a separate server."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``vshard`` module is based on the concept of :ref:`virtual buckets <vshard-vbuckets>`, where a tuple set is partitioned into a large number of abstract virtual nodes (**virtual buckets**, further just **buckets**) rather than into a smaller number of physical nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid "The dataset is partitioned using **sharding keys** (bucket id numbers). Hashing a sharding key into a large number of buckets allows seamlessly changing the number of servers in the cluster. The **rebalancing mechanism** distributes buckets evenly among all shards in case some servers were added or removed."
msgstr ""

msgid "The buckets have **states**, so it is easy to monitor the server states. For example, a server instance is active and available for all types of requests, or a failover occurred and the instance accepts only read requests."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``vshard`` module provides analogs of the **data-manipulation functions** of the Tarantool ``box`` library (select, insert, replace, update, delete) for sharding-aware applications."
