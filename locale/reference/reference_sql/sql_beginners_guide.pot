msgid "so we do not use longitude/latitude navigation by talking about \"Row#2 Column #2\", we use the contents of the Name column and the name of the Size column by talking about \"the size, where the name is 'clock'\". To be more exact, this is what we say:"

msgstr ""

msgid "``box.space.MODULES:select()[2][2]``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Well, you can do that. One of the advantages of Tarantool is that if you can get data via an SQL statement, then you can get the same data via a NoSQL request. But the reverse is not true, because not all NoSQL tuple sets are definable as SQL tables. These restrictions apply for SQL that do not apply for NoSQL: |br| 1. Every column must have a name. |br| 2. Every column must have a scalar type (Tarantool is relaxed about which particular scalar type you can have, but there is no way to index and search arrays, tables within tables, or what MessagePack calls \"maps\".)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tarantool/NoSQL's \"format\" clause causes the same restrictions."

msgstr ""

msgid "This is how to create the modules table:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``CREATE TABLE modules (name STRING, size INTEGER, purpose STRING, PRIMARY KEY (name));``"
msgstr ""

msgid "The words that are IN CAPITAL LETTERS are \"keywords\" (although it is only a convention in this manual that keywords are in capital letters, in practice many programmers prefer to avoid shouting). A keyword has meaning for the SQL parser so many keywords are reserved, they cannot be used as names unless they are enclosed inside quotation marks."
msgstr ""

msgid "The word \"modules\" is a \"table name\", and the words \"name\" and \"size\" and \"purpose\" are \"column names\". All tables and all columns must have names."
msgstr ""

msgid "The words \"STRING\" and \"INTEGER\" are \"data types\". STRING means \"the contents should be characters, the length is indefinite, the equivalent NoSQL type is 'string''\". INTEGER means \"the contents should be numbers without decimal points, the equivalent NoSQL type is 'integer'\". Tarantool supports other data types but our example table has data types from the two main groups, namely, data types for numbers and data types for strings."
msgstr ""

msgid "The final clause, PRIMARY KEY (name), means that the name column is the main column used to identify the row."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Nulls**"
msgstr ""

msgid "Frequently it is necessary, at least temporarily, that a column value should be NULL. Typical situations are: the value is unknown, or the value is not applicable. For example, you might make a module as a placeholder but you don't want to say its size or purpose. If such things are possible, the column is \"nullable\". Our name column cannot contain nulls, and it could be defined explicitly as \"name STRING NOT NULL\", but in this case that's unnecessary -- a column defined as PRIMARY KEY is automatically NOT NULL."
msgstr ""

msgid "Is a NULL in SQL the same thing as a nil in Lua? No, but it is close enough that there will be confusion. When nil means \"unknown\" or \"inapplicable\", yes. But when nil means \"nonexistent\" or \"type is nil\", no. NULL is a value, it has a data type because it is inside a column which is defined with that data type."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Creating an index**"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is how to create indexes for the modules table:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``CREATE INDEX size ON modules (size);`` |br| ``CREATE UNIQUE INDEX purpose ON modules (purpose);``"
msgstr ""

msgid "There is no need to create an index on the name column, because Tarantool creates an index automatically when it sees a PRIMARY KEY clause in the CREATE TABLE statement. In fact there is no need to create indexes on the size or purpose columns either -- if indexes don't exist, then it is still possible to use the columns for searches. Typically people create non-primary indexes, also called secondary indexes, when it becomes clear that the table will grow large and searches will be frequent, because searching with an index is generally much faster than searching without an index."
msgstr ""

msgid "Another use for indexes is to enforce uniqueness. When an index is created with CREATE UNIQUE INDEX for the purpose column, it is not possible to have duplicate values in that column."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Data change**"
msgstr ""

msgid "Putting data into a table is called \"inserting\". Changing data is called \"updating\". Removing data is called \"deleting\". Together, the three SQL statements INSERT plus UPDATE plus DELETE are the three main \"data-change\" statements."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is how to insert, update, and delete a row in the modules table:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``INSERT INTO modules VALUES ('json', 14, 'format functions for JSON');`` |br| ``UPDATE modules SET size = 15 WHERE name = 'json';`` |br| ``DELETE FROM modules WHERE name = 'json';``"
msgstr ""

msgid "The corresponding non-SQL Tarantool requests would be:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``box.space.MODULES:insert{'json', 14, 'format functions for JSON'}`` |br| ``box.space.MODULES:update('json', {{'=', 2, 15}})`` |br| ``box.space.MODULES:delete{'json'}`` |br|"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is how we would populate the table with the values that we showed earlier:"

msgid "``INSERT INTO modules VALUES ('box', 1432, 'Database Management');`` |br| ``INSERT INTO modules VALUES ('clock', 188, 'Seconds');`` |br| ``INSERT INTO modules VALUES ('crypto', 4, 'Cryptography');`` |br|"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Constraints**"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some data-change statements are illegal due to something in the table's definition. This is called \"constraining what can be done\". We have already seen some types of constraints ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "NOT NULL -- if a column is defined with a NOT NULL clause, it is illegal to put NULL into it. A primary-key column is automatically NOT NULL."
msgstr ""

msgid "UNIQUE -- if a column has a UNIQUE index, it is illegal to put a duplicate into it. A primary-key column automatically has a UNIQUE index."
msgstr ""

msgid "data domain -- if a column is defined as having data type INTEGER, it is illegal to put a non-number into it. More generally, if a value doesn't correspond to the data type of the definition, it is illegal. However, some database management systems (DBMSs) are very forgiving and will try to make allowances for bad values rather than reject them; Tarantool is one of those DBMSs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now, here are other types of constraints ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "CHECK -- a table description can have a clause \"CHECK (conditional expression)\". For example, if the CREATE TABLE modules statement looked like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "CREATE TABLE modules (name STRING,\n"
"                      size INTEGER,\n"
"                      purpose STRING,\n"
"                      PRIMARY KEY (name),\n"
"                      CHECK (size > 0));"
msgstr ""

msgid "then this INSERT statement would be illegal: |br| ``INSERT INTO modules VALUES ('box', 0, 'The Database Kernel');`` |br| because there is a CHECK constraint saying that the second column, the size column, cannot contain a value which is less than or equal to zero. Try this instead: |br| ``INSERT INTO modules VALUES ('box', 1, 'The Database Kernel');``"
msgstr ""

msgid "FOREIGN KEY -- a table description can have a clause \"FOREIGN KEY (column-list) REFERENCES table (column-list)\". For example, if there is a new table \"submodules\" which in a way depends on the modules table, it can be defined like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "CREATE TABLE submodules (name STRING,\n"
"                         module_name STRING,\n"
"                         size INTEGER,\n"
"                         purpose STRING,\n"
"                         PRIMARY KEY (name),\n"
"                         FOREIGN KEY (module_name) REFERENCES\n"
"                         modules (name));"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now try to insert a new row into this submodules table:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``INSERT INTO submodules VALUES`` |br| |nbsp| |nbsp| ``('space', 'Box', 10000, 'insert etc.');``"
msgstr ""

msgid "The insert will fail because the second column (module_name) refers to the name column in the modules table, and the name column in the modules table does not contain 'Box'. However, it does contain 'box'. By default searches in Tarantool's SQL use a binary collation. This will work:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``INSERT INTO submodules`` |br| |nbsp| |nbsp| ``VALUES ('space', 'box', 10000, 'insert etc.');``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now try to delete the new row from the modules table:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``DELETE FROM modules WHERE name = 'box';``"
msgstr ""

msgid "The delete will fail because the second column (module_name) in the submodules table refers to the name column in the modules table, and the name column in the modules table would not contain 'box' if the delete succeeded. So the FOREIGN KEY constraint affects both the table which contains the FOREIGN KEY clause and the table that the FOREIGN KEY clause refers to."
msgstr ""

msgid "The constraints in a table's definition -- NOT NULL, UNIQUE, data domain, CHECK, and FOREIGN KEY -- are guarantors of the database's integrity. It is important that they are fixed and well-defined parts of the definition, and hard to bypass with SQL. This is often seen as a difference between SQL and NoSQL -- SQL emphasizes law and order, NoSQL emphasizes freedom and making your own rules."

msgid "**Table Relationships**"

msgid "Think about the two tables that we have discussed so far:"

"                         modules (name));"
msgstr ""

msgid "Because of the FOREIGN KEYS clause in the submodules table, there is clearly a many-to-one relationship: |br| submodules -->> modules |br| that is, every submodules row must refer to one (and only one) modules row, while every modules row can be referred to in zero or more submodules rows."
msgstr ""

msgid "Table relationships are important, but beware: do not trust anyone who tells you that databases made with SQL are relational \"because there are relationships between tables\". That is wrong. We will see why when we talk about what makes a database relational, later."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Selecting with WHERE**"
msgstr ""

msgid "We gave a simple example of a SELECT statement earlier:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The clause \"WHERE name = 'clock'\" is legal in other statements -- we have seen it in UPDATE and DELETE -- but here we will only give examples with SELECT."
msgstr ""

msgid "The first variation is that the WHERE clause does not have to be specified at all, it is optional. So this statement would return all rows:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``SELECT size FROM modules;``"
msgstr ""

msgid "The second variation is that the comparison operator does not have to be '=', it can be anything that makes sense: '>' or '>=' or '<' or '<=', or 'LIKE' which is an operator that works with strings that may contain wildcard characters '_' meaning 'match any one character' or '%' meaning 'match any zero or one or many characters'. These are legal statements which return all rows:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``SELECT size FROM modules WHERE name >= '';`` |br| ``SELECT size FROM modules WHERE name LIKE '%';``"
msgstr ""

msgid "The third variation is that IS [NOT] NULL is a special condition. Remembering that the NULL value can mean \"it is unknown what the value should be\", and supposing that in some row the size is NULL, then the condition \"size > 10\" is not certainly true and it is not certainly false, so it is evaluated as \"unknown\". Ordinarily the application of a WHERE clause filters out both false and unknown results. So when searching for NULL, say IS NULL; when searching anything that is not NULL, say IS NOT NULL. This statement will return all rows because (due to the definition) there are no NULLs in the name column:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``SELECT size FROM modules WHERE name IS NOT NULL;``"
msgstr ""

msgid "The fourth variation is that conditions can be combined with AND / OR, and negated with NOT."
msgstr ""

msgid "So this statement would return all rows (the first condition is false but the second condition is true, and OR means \"return true if either condition is true\"):"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Selecting with a select list**"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yet again, here is a simple example of a SELECT statement:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The words between SELECT and FROM are the select list. In this case, the select list is just one word: size. Formally it means that the desire is to return the size values, and technically the name for picking a particular column is called \"projection\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "The first variation is that one can specify any column in any order:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``SELECT name, purpose, size FROM modules;``"
msgstr ""

msgid "The second variation is that one can specify an expression, it does not have to be a column name, it does not even have to include a column name. The common expression operators for numbers are the arithmetic operators ``+ - / *``; the common expression operator for strings is the concatenation operator ||. For example this statement will return 8, 'XY':"
msgstr ""

msgid "``SELECT size * 2, 'X' || 'Y' FROM modules WHERE size = 4;``"
msgstr ""

msgid "The third variation is that one can add a clause [AS name] after every expression, so that in the return the column titles will make sense. This is especially important when a title might otherwise be ambiguous or meaningless. For example this statement will return 8, 'XY' as before"

msgid "``SELECT size * 2 AS double_size, 'X' || 'Y' AS concatenated_literals  FROM modules`` |br| |nbsp| |nbsp| ``WHERE size = 4;``"

Also it is unstable, because there is a way to change a table's definition (the ALTER statement, which is an advanced topic). Nevertheless, although it might be bad to use it for production, it is handy to use it for introduction, so we will use ``\"*\"`` in several examples."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Select with subqueries**"
msgstr ""

msgid "Remember that we have a modules table and we have a submodules table. Suppose that we want to list the submodules that refer to modules for which the purpose is X.

msgid "Every time we have searched in the modules table, the rows have come out in alphabetical order by name: 'box', then 'clock', then 'crypto'. However, if we want to be sure about the order, or if we want a different order, we will have to be explicit and add a clause: ``ORDER BY column-name [ASC|DESC]``.

msgid "Therefore you can take advantage of Tarantool's NoSQL features even though your primary language is SQL. Here are some possibilities."
msgstr ""

msgid "(1) NoSQL applications written in one of the connector languages may be slightly faster than SQL applications because SQL statements may require more parsing and may be translated to NoSQL requests."
msgstr ""

msgid "(2) You can write stored procedures in Lua, combining Lua loop-control and Lua library-access statements with SQL statements. These routines are executed on the server, which is the principal advantage of pure-SQL stored procedures."
msgstr ""

msgid "(3) There are some options that are implemented in NoSQL that are not (yet) implemented in SQL. For example you can use NoSQL to change an index option, and to deny access to users named 'guest'."
msgstr ""

msgid "(4) System spaces such as _space and _index can be accessed with SQL SELECT statements. This is not quite the same as an information_schema, but it does mean that you can use SQL to access the database's metadata catalog."
msgstr ""

msgid "Fields in NoSQL spaces can be accessed with SQL if and only if they are scalar and are defined in format clauses. Indexes of NoSQL spaces will be used with SQL if and only if they are TREE indexes."

msgid "Although we do not advertise Tarantool as \"relational\", we claim that Tarantool complies with these rules, with the following caveats and exceptions ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "The rules state that all data must be viewable as relations. A Tarantool SQL table is a relation. However, it is possible to have duplicate values in SQL tables and it is possible to have an implicit ordering. Those characteristics are not allowed for true relations."
msgstr ""

msgid "The rules state that there must be a dynamic online catalog. Tarantool has one but some metadata is missing from it."
msgstr ""

msgid "The rules state that the data language must support authorization. Tarantool's SQL does not. Authorization occurs via NoSQL requests."
msgstr ""

msgid "The rules require that data must be physically independent (from underlying storage changes) and logically independent (from application program changes). So far we do not have enough experience to make this guarantee."
msgstr ""

msgid "The rules require certain types of updatable views. Tarantool's views are not updatable."
msgstr ""

msgid "The rules state that it should be impossible to use a low-level language to bypass integrity as defined in the relational-level language. In our case, this is not true, for example one can execute a request with Tarantool's NoSQL to violate a foreign-key constraint that was defined with Tarantool's SQL."
