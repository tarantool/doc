"There are lies, then there is statistics, but the first place in "
"misrepresenting the truth is undoubtedly owned by benchmarks.Comparing "
"Tarantool with other systems, apples to apples, is not strictly correct: "
"the server networking subsystem is fully asynchronous and it's possible "
"to proxy all clients via a single socket. In this case, responses to "
"queries are sent as soon as they are ready. Most production applications "
"use asynchronous and batched I/O with Tarantool.As long as the overhead "
"of system calls and context switches is the single largest contributor to"
" the cost of serving a single request, use of batched and multiplexed I/O"
" produces an order of magnitude better results, when compared with "
"traditional multi-threaded workloads. A tool we developed for our own "
"use, nosqlbench, utilizes this approach at full.However, to compare with "
"the rest of the world, a standardized benchmarking kit is more "
"appropriate. This is why Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark |copy| was used "
"to produce the charts below. Since YCSB was developed to compare cloud "
"key/value servers, it provides a very narrow view at performance of a "
"tested server. For example, performance of secondary keys or overhead of "
"locking (which Tarantool doesn't have) is not tested at all."
