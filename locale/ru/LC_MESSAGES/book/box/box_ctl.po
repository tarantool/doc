"The ``box.ctl`` submodule contains two functions: ``wait_ro`` (wait until"
" read-only) and ``wait_rw`` (wait until read-write). The functions are "
"useful during initialization of a server."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A particular use is for :ref:`box_once() <box-once>`. For example, when a"
" replica is initializing, it may call a ``box.once()`` function while the"
" server is still in read-only mode, and fail to make changes that are "
"necessary only once before the replica is fully initialized. This could "
"cause conflicts between a master and a replica if the master is in read-"
"write mode and the replica is in read-only mode. Waiting until \"read "
"only mode = false\" solves this problem."

msgid ""
"To see whether a function is already in read-only or read-write mode, "
"check :ref:`box.info.ro <box_introspection-box_info>`."
