msgid ""
"The ``box.slab`` submodule provides access to slab allocator statistics. "
"The slab allocator is the main allocator used to store :ref:`tuples "
"<index-box_tuple>`. This can be used to monitor the total memory usage "
"and memory fragmentation."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Apparently your memory is highly fragmented. Check how many slab classes "
"you have by looking at ``box.slab.stats()`` and counting the number of "
"different classes. If there are many slab classes (more than a few "
"dozens), you may run out of memory even though memory utilization is not "
"high. While each slab may have few items used, whenever a tuple of a size"
" different from any existing slab class size is allocated, Tarantool may "
"need to get a new slab from the slab arena, and since the arena has few "
"empty slabs left, it will attempt to increase its quota usage, which, in "
"turn, may end up with an out-of-memory error due to the low remaining "
"quota."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Case 2:** ``items_used_ratio`` > 0.9"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You are running out of memory. All memory utilization indicators are "
"high. Your memory is not fragmented, but there are few reserves left on "
"each slab allocator level. You should consider increasing Tarantool's "
"memory limit (``box.cfg.memtx_memory``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**To sum up:** your main out-of-memory indicator is ``quota_used_ratio``."
" However, there are lots of perfectly stable setups with a high "
"``quota_used_ratio``, so you only need to pay attention to it when both "
"arena and item used ratio are also high."
