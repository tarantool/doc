msgid "About Tarantool Cartridge"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tarantool Cartridge allows you to easily develop Tarantool-based "
"applications and run them on one or more Tarantool instances organized "
"into a cluster."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a cluster management tool, Tarantool Cartridge provides your cluster-"
"aware applications with the following key benefits:"
msgstr ""

msgid "horizontal scalability and load balancing via built-in automatic sharding;"
msgstr ""

msgid "asynchronous replication;"
msgstr ""

msgid "automatic failover;"
msgstr ""

msgid "centralized cluster control via GUI or API;"
msgstr ""

msgid "automatic configuration synchronization;"
msgstr ""

msgid "instance functionality segregation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A Tarantool Cartridge cluster can segregate functionality between "
"instances via built-in and custom (user-defined) **cluster roles**. You "
"can toggle instances on and off on the fly during cluster operation. This"
" allows you to put different types of workloads (e.g., compute- and "
"transaction-intensive ones) on different physical servers with dedicated "
"hardware."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tarantool Cartridge has an external utility called `cartridge-cli "
"<https://github.com/tarantool/cartridge-cli>`_ which provides you with "
"utilities and templates to help:"
msgstr ""

msgid "easily set up a development environment for your applications;"
msgstr ""

msgid "plug the necessary Lua modules;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"pack the applications in an environment-independent way: together with "
"module binaries and Tarantool executables."
msgstr ""

msgid "Getting Started"
msgstr ""

msgid "Create first application"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To get a template application that uses Tarantool Cartridge and run it "
"you need to install `cartridge-cli` utility (supposing that `Tarantool "
"<https://www.tarantool.io/en/download/>`_ is already installed)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Long story short, copy-paste it into console:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"tarantoolctl rocks install cartridge-cli\n"
".rocks/bin/cartridge create --name myapp\n"
"cd myapp\n"
"../.rocks/bin/cartridge build\n"
"../.rocks/bin/cartridge start"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That's all! You can visit `http://localhost:8081 "
"<http://localhost:8081>`_ and see your application Admin Web UI:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Next stages"
msgstr ""

msgid "**See:**"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Step-by-step `getting started guide <https://github.com/tarantool"
"/cartridge-cli/blob/master/examples/getting-started-app/README.md>`_ in "
"the ``cartridge-cli`` repository."

msgid "Contribution"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"From the point of view of cartridge contributor, the workflow differs: it"
" implies building the project from source (documentation, webui) and "
"running tests."
msgstr ""

msgid "Building from source"
msgstr ""

msgid "Prerequisites:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``tarantool``, ``tarantool-dev`` (instructions: "
"`https://www.tarantool.io/en/download/?v=1.10 "
"<https://www.tarantool.io/en/download/?v=1.10>`_);"
msgstr ""

msgid "``git``, ``gcc``, ``cmake``."
msgstr ""

msgid "The fastest way to build the project is to skip building Web UI:"
msgstr ""

msgid "CMAKE_DUMMY_WEBUI=true tarantoolctl rocks make"
msgstr ""

msgid "But if you want to build frontend too, you'll also need:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``nodejs`` >= 8 (`instructions "
"<https://github.com/nodesource/distributions>`_);"
msgstr ""

msgid "``npm`` >= 6."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Documentation is generated from source code, but only if `ldoc` tool is "
"installed:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"tarantoolctl rocks install ldoc --server=http://rocks.moonscript.org\n"
"tarantoolctl rocks make"
msgstr ""

msgid "Running demo cluster"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are several example entrypoints which are mostly used for testing, "
"but can also be useful for demo purposes or experiments:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""

"\n"
"# or select specific entrypoint\n"
