"Almost all errors in Cartridge follow `return nil, err` style, where "
"`err` is an error object produced by ``errors` "
"<https://github.com/tarantool/errors>`_ module. Cartridge doesn't raise "
"errors except for bugs and functions contracts mismatch. Developing new "
"roles should follow these guidelines as well."

"For `errors.pcall` there is no difference between `return nil, err` and "
"`error()` approaches."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that `errors.pcall` API differs from vanilla lua ``pcall` "

"values returned from the call. If there is error, it returns `nil` "
