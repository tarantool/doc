msgid "Failover architecture"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of important concepts in cluster topology is **the leader** setting. "
"Leader is an instance, which is responsible for performing key "
"operations, for simplicity one can think of it as of the only writable "
"master. Every replica set has its own leader, and there's usually not "
"more than one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Which instance will become a leader depends on topology settings and "
"failover configuration."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of important topology parameters is the **failover priority** within "
"replica set. It's an ordered list of instances. By default, the first "
"instance in the list will become a leader, but with failover enabled it "
"may be changed automatically if the first one is malfunctioning."
msgstr ""

msgid "Instance configuration upon leadership change"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When cartridge configures roles it takes into account **leadership map** "
"(consolidated in `failover.lua` module). Leadership map is composed when "
"the instance enters `ConfiguringRoles` state for the first time. Later "
"the map is updated according to the failover mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Every change is leadership map is accompanied by the instance re-"
"configuration. When the map changes the cartridge updates `read_only` "
"setting and calls `apply_config` callback for every role. It also "
"specifies `is_master` flag (which actually means `is_leader`, but wasn't "
"renamed yet due to historical reasons)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's important to say, that we discuss distributed system. And every "
"instance has its own opinion. Even if all opinions coincide there still "
"may be races between instances, and one (an application developer) should"
" take them into account when designing roles and their interaction."
msgstr ""

msgid "Leader appointment rules"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The logics behind leader election depends on the **failover mode** which "
"are three: disabled, eventual, and stateful."
msgstr ""

msgid "Disabled mode"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the simplest case. The leader is always the first instance in "
"failover priority. No automatic switching is performed. When it's dead, "
"it's dead."
msgstr ""

msgid "Eventual failover"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In `eventual` mode the leader isn't elected consistently. Instead, every "
"instance in cluster thinks the leader is the first **healthy** server in "
"replicaset, while instance health is determined according to membership "
"status (the SWIM protocol)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Leader election in eventual failover mode should be spoken of as follows."
" Suppose there are two replica sets in cluster - a single router \"R\" "
"and a pair of storages \"S1\" and \"S2\". Than we can say: all three R, "
"S1, S2 agree that S1 is the leader."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"SWIM protocol makes us sure that *eventually* all instances will find "
"common ground, but it's not guaranteed for every intermediate moment of "
"time. So we may come into situation soon after S1 dies, when R already "
"informed and thinks S2 is a leader, but S2 didn't receive the gossip yet "
"and still thinks he's not. The similar situation can result in both S1 "
"and S2 considering themselves to be leaders."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Moreover, SWIM protocol isn't perfect and still can produce false-"
"negative gossips (announce the instance is dead when it's not)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stateful failover"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This mode relies on two new actors. As before, every instance composes "
"his own leadership map, but now it's fetched from **external state "
"provider** (that's why it's called stateful). In future cartridge is "
"going to support different providers, such as consul or etcd, but "
"nowadays there's only one - `stateboard`. It's a stand-alone Tarantool "
"instance which implements domain specific key-value storage (simply "
"`replicaset_uuid -> leader_uuid`) and a locking mechanism."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Changes in leadership map are obtained form stateboard with the long "
"polling technique."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All decisions are made by **the coordinator** - the one who holds the "
"lock. Coordinator is implemented as a built-in cartridge role. There may "
"be many instances with the coordinator role enabled, but only one of them"
" could acquire the lock at the same time. We call him the \"active\" one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The lock is released automatically when TCP connection is closed, or it "
"may expire if coordinator becomes unresponsive (the timeout is set by "
"stateboard `--lock_delay` option), so the coordinator renews it from time"
" to time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Coordinator makes his decision basing on SWIM data, but he does it "
"slightly differently than eventual failover does:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Right after acquiring the lock in the state provider, coordinator fetches"
" leadership map."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If there is no appointment for a replicaset, coordinator appoints the "
"first leader according to failover priority notwithstanding it's SWIM "
"status."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a leader becomes degraded, coordinator makes another decision. New "
"leader is the first healthy instance from failover priority list. Healthy"
" leaders aren't switched automatically even if it's not first. Changing "
"failover priority doesn't affect it too."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Every appointment (self-made or fetched) is immune for the first time "
"(which is controlled with `IMMUNITY_TIMEOUT` option)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The case: external provider outage"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this case instances do nothing: who was a leader remains a leader, who"
" was read-only remains read-only. If any instance restarts during "
"external state provider outage, it composes empty leadership map, i.e. it"
" doesn't know who's actually a leader and thinks there a none of them."
msgstr ""

msgid "The case: coordinator outage"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Active coordinator may be absent in cluster either because of a failure "
"or due to disabling the role everywhere. Just like previously, instances "
"do nothing about it - they keep fetching leadership map from the state "
"provider. But it will remain the same until a coordinator appears."
msgstr ""

msgid "Manual leader promotion"
msgstr ""

msgid "It differs a lot depending on the failover mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In disabled and eventual modes one can only promote a leader by changing "
"failover priority (apply new clusterwide configuration)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In stateful mode failover priority doesn't make much sence (except for "
"the first appointment). Instead, one should use separate promotion API "
"which pushes manual appointment to the state provider."
msgstr ""

msgid "Failover configuration"
msgstr ""

msgid "These are cluster-wide parameters:"
msgstr ""

msgid "`mode`: \"disabled\" / \"eventual\" / \"stateful\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "`state_provider`: only \"tarantool\" is supported for now."
msgstr ""

msgid "`tarantool_params`: `{uri = \"...\", password = \"...\"}`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Lua API"
msgstr ""

msgid "See:"

msgid "Stateboard configuration"
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgid "`listen`"
msgstr ""

msgid "`workdir`"
msgstr ""

msgid "`password`"
msgstr ""

"line arguments or via environment variables, e.g.:"
msgstr ""

" qwerty"
msgstr ""

msgid "Fine-tuning failover behavior"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Besides failover priority and mode there are few other private options "
"that influence failover operation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`LONGPOLL_TIMEOUT` (`failover`) - the long polling timeout to fetch new "
"appointments (default: 30);"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`NETBOX_CALL_TIMEOUT` (`failover/coordinator`) - `stateboard` client "
"connection timeout applied to all communications (default: 1);"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`RECONNECT_PERIOD` (`coordinator`) - time to reconnect to the "
"`stateboard` if it's unreachable (default: 5);"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`IMMUNITY_TIMEOUT` (`coordinator`) - minimal amount of time to wait "
"before overriding an appointment (default: 15)."
