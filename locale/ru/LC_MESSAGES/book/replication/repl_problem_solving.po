"**Case:** you have two instances of Tarantool. For example, you try to "
"make a ``replace`` operation with the same primary key on both instances "
"in the same time. This will cause a conflict over which tuple to save and"
" which one to discard."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tarantool :ref:`trigger functions <triggers>` can help here to implement "
"the rules of conflict resolution on some condition. For example, if you "
"have a timestamp, you can declare saving the tuple with the bigger one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, you need a :ref:`before_replace() <box_space-before_replace>` "
"trigger on the space which may have conflicts. In this trigger you can "
"compare the old and new replica records and choose which one to use (or "
"skip the update entirely, or merge two records together)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then you need to set the trigger at the right time, before the space "
"starts to receive any updates. The way you usually set the "
"``before_replace`` trigger is right when the space is created, so you "
"need a trigger to set another trigger on the system space ``_space``, to "
"capture the moment when your space is created and set the trigger there. "
"This can be an :ref:`on_replace() <box_space-on_replace>` trigger."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The difference between ``before_replace`` and ``on_replace`` is that "
"``on_replace`` is called after a row is inserted into the space, and "
"``before_replace`` is called before that."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To set a ``_space:on_replace()`` trigger correctly, you also need the "
"right timing. The best timing to use it is when ``_space`` is just "
"created, which is the :ref:`box.ctl.on_schema_init() <box_ctl-"
"on_schema_init>` trigger."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You will also need to utilize ``box.on_commit`` to get access to the "
"space being created. The resulting snippet would be the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"local my_space_name = 'my_space'\n"
"local my_trigger = function(old, new) ... end -- your function resolving "
"a conflict\n"
"box.schema.on_schema_init(function()\n"
"    box.space._space:on_replace(function(_, new_space)\n"
"        if new_space.name == my_space_name then\n"
"            box.on_commit(function()\n"
"                box.space[my_space_name]:before_replace(my_trigger)\n"
"            end\n"
"        end\n"
"    end)\n"
