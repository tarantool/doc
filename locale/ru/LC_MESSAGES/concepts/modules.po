"Any logic that is used in Tarantool can be packaged as an application (like "
"a :ref:`Cartridge application <tarantool-cartridge>`) or a reusable "
"**module**. A module is an optional library that enhances Tarantool "
"functionality. It can be used by Tarantool applications or other modules. "
"Modules allow for easier code management and hot code reload without "
"restarting the Tarantool instance. Like applications, modules in Tarantool "
"can be written in Lua, C, or C++. Lua modules are also referred to as "
"\"rocks\"."
