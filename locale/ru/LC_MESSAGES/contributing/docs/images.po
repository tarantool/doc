"Images are useful in explanations of concepts and structures. When you "
"introduce a term or describe a structure of multiple interconnected parts "
"(such as a cluster), consider illustrating it with a diagram. If you are "
"explaining how to use a GUI, check if a screenshot can make the doc clearer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that illustrations should complement the text, not replace it. Even "
"with an image, the text should be enough for readers to understand the "
"topic."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Don't overuse images: they are harder to support than text. Use them only if"
" they bring an obvious benefit."

msgid "Diagrams"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is a basic set of diagram elements -- blocks, arrows, and other -- to "
"use in Tarantool docs. It is stored in `this Miro board "
"<https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPYdYCng=/>`_. It also provides basic rules "
"for creating diagrams."

msgid "Size"
msgstr ""

msgid "There are two sizes of diagram elements:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**M** – bigger elements to use in diagrams with a small number of elements."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**S** – smaller elements to use in diagrams with a big number of elements."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Avoid changing the size of diagram elements unless it's absolutely "
"necessary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The diagrams should have the same width. This guarantees that their elements"
" have the same size on pages. The examples in the Miro board have frames of "
"the right width. Copy the frame and and place your diagram in it without "
"changing the frame width."
msgstr ""

msgid "Exporting"
msgstr ""

msgid "To save the diagram to a file:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make the frame transparent so that it isn't shown in the resulting image "
"(set its color to \"no color\")."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Select all elements together with the frame and click **Copy as image** in "
"the context menu (under the three dots). The image will be copied to the "
"clipboard."

msgid "Screenshots"

msgid "Ensure screenshot consistency on the page:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Screenshots must show the same environment: operating system, product "
"version, visual theme, and so on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The configuration and data must be consistent. For example, if you've shown "
"spaces with data on a screenshot, subsequent screenshots must have the same "
"data, too."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Size and resolution must be the same across the page unless you want to zoom"
" in to a specific part of the screen."
