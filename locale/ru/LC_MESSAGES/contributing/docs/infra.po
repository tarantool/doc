"other Tarantool-related products and modules, for example, `Cartridge "

"<https://github.com/tarantool/metrics/tree/master/doc/monitoring>`__, and "

"presented at the `official web-site <http://www.tarantool.io/en/doc>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "The steps to do that are the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "1. Add a submodule"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, we need to add a repository containing the content source files as a "
"submodule."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make sure you are in the root directory of the documentation repository."
msgstr ""

msgid "In the ``./modules`` directory, add the new submodule:"

msgid ""
"cd modules\n"
"git submodule add https://<path_to_submodule_repository>\n"
"cd .."

msgid ""
"Check that the new submodule appears in the ``.gitmodules`` file, for "

msgid ""
"[submodule \"modules/metrics\"]\n"

"   url = https://github.com/tarantool/metrics.git"

msgid "2. Update build_submodules.sh"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next, we should define what directories and files are to be copied from the "
"submodule repository into the documentation one before building "
"documentation. These settings are defined in the ``build_submodules.sh`` "
"file which is in the root directory of the documentation repository."
msgstr ""

" the settings."

"In case of the ``metrics`` submodule, the content source files are in the "
"``./doc/monitoring`` directory of the submodule repository. In the final "

"(``https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/book/monitoring/``)."
msgstr ""

msgid "So, we need to:"
msgstr ""

msgid "create a directory at ``./doc/book/monitoring/``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"copy the entire content of the  ``./modules/metrics/doc/monitoring/`` "
"directory to ``./doc/book/monitoring/``."
