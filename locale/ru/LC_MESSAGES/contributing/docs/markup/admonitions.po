"Sometimes you need to highlight a piece of information. For this purpose we "
"use admonitions."
msgstr ""

msgid "In Tarantool we have 3 variants of css-style for admonitions:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Note:"
msgstr ""

msgid "..  note::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a note. We use it to highlight extra information that might be "
"helpful for users."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, :ref:`here <net_box-new>` we provide a user with extra "
"information about using ``net_box.new()`` function."
msgstr ""

msgid "Warning:"
msgstr ""

msgid "..  warning::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a warning. As you might guess, we use it to warn users about "
"something."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, in the description of "
":doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_session/on_connect` trigger we warn a "
"user about some consequences of his actions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Important:"
msgstr ""

msgid "..  important::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This block contains essential information that the user should know while "
"doing something."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, the block :doc:`in Getting Started with Docker </how-"
"to/getting_started_go>` is used to warn the user against closing the "
"terminal window."
msgstr ""

msgid "Custom admonition:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"..  admonition:: Your title\n"
"    :class: fact"
msgstr ""

msgid "Your title"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a fact. ``fact`` is our custom CSS class. Use it when neither note "
"nor warning doesn't fit."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that this type requires a title."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, :ref:`here <box-txn_management>` we highlight the rules that "
"are necessary to read, and that's why we use ``fact``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The docutils `documentation "
"<https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#admonitions>`_"
" offers many more variants for admonitions, but for now these three are "
"enough for us. If you think that it is time to create the new style for some"
" of these types, feel free to contribute or contact us to create a task."
