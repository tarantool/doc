"It's good practice to wrap lines in documentation source text. It makes "
"source better readable and results in lesser ``git diff``'s. The recommended"
" limit is 80 characters per line for plain text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In new documents, try to wrap lines by sentences, or by parts of a complex "
"sentence. Don't wrap formatted text if it affects rST readability and/or "

"In rST, indents play exactly the same role as in Python: they denote object "

msgid ""
"For example, a list starts with a marker, then come some spaces and text. "
"From there, all lines relating to that list item must be at the same "
"indentation level. We can continue the list item by creating a second "
"paragraph in it. To do that we have to leave it at the same level."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We can put a new object inside: another list, or a block of code. Then we "
"have to indent 4 more spaces."

msgid ""
"It's best if all indents are multiples of 4 spaces, even in lists. Otherwise"
" the document is not consistent. Also, it is much easier to put indents with"
" tabs than manually."

"Note that you have to use two or three spaces instead of one. It is allowed "
