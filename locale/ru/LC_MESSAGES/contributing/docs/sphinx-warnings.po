msgid "Could not lex literal_block as \"...\". Highlighting skipped"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This warning means that there's a ``code-block`` with an unknown lexer. Most"
" probably, it's a typo. Check out the `full list of Pygments lexers "
"<https://pygments.org/docs/lexers/>`_ for the right spelling."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, sometimes there's no appropriate lexer or the code snippet can't be"

msgid "Document isn't included in any toctree"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This warning means that you forgot to put the document name in the toctree."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you don't want to include the document in a toctree, place the "
"``:orphan:`` directive at the top of the file. If this file is already "
"included somewhere or reused, add it to the _includes directory. Sphinx "
"ignores everything in this directory because we list it among "
"``exclude_patterns`` in ``conf.py``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Duplicate label \"...\", other instance in \".../.../...\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This happens if you include the contents of a file into another file, when "
"the included file has tags in it. In this, Sphinx thinks the tags are "
