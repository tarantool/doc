"People usually read technical documentation because they want something up "
"and running quickly. Write simpler, more concise sentences."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Split the content into smaller paragraphs to improve readability. This will "
"also eliminate the need for using ``|br|`` and help us translate content "
"faster. Any paragraph over 6 sentences is large."

msgid "Keep your audience in mind"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Consider your audience's level. A getting started guide should be written in"
" simpler terms than an advanced internals description."

msgid "Don't say \"we\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Only use the pronoun \"we\" in entry-level texts like getting started "

msgid "Refer to absolute time"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Temporal adverbs like \"today\", \"currently\", \"now\", \"in the future\", "
"etc. are relative -- that is, they are based on the time the documentation "
"is created."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead of these words, use absolute terms like version numbers or years. "
"The meaning of those terms doesn't change over time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If technical documentation is tied semantically to the time it was created, "
