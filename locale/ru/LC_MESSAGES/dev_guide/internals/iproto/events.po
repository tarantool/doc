"The remote watcher (event subscription) protocol works in the following way:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The client sends an ``IPROTO_WATCH`` packet to subscribe to the updates of a"
" specified key defined on the server."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The server sends an ``IPROTO_EVENT`` packet to the subscribed client after "
"registration. The packet contains the key name and its current value. After "
"that, the packet is sent every time the key value is updated with "
"``box.broadcast()``, provided that the last notification was acknowledged "
"(see below)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After receiving the notification, the client sends an ``IPROTO_WATCH`` "
"packet to acknowledge the notification."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the client doesn't want to receive any more notifications, it "
"unsubscribes by sending an ``IPROTO_UNWATCH`` packet."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All the three request types are asynchronous -- the receiving end doesn't "
"send a packet in reply to any of them. Therefore, neither of them has a sync"
