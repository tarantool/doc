" for a specific Tarantool instance. To enable the flight recorder, set the "

msgid ""
"After ``flightrec_enabled`` is set to ``true``, the flight recorder starts "
"collecting data in the flight recording file  ``current.ttfr``. This file is"
" stored in the :ref:`memtx_dir <cfg_basic-memtx_dir>` directory. If the "
"instance crashes and reboots, Tarantool rotates the flight recording: "
"``current.ttfr`` is renamed to ``<timestamp>.ttfr`` (for example, "
"``20230411T050721.ttfr``) and the new ``current.ttfr`` file is created for "
"collecting data. In the case of correct shutdown (for example, using "
"``os.exit()``), Tarantool continues writing to the existing ``current.ttfr``"
