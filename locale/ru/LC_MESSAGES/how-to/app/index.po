"Using Tarantool as an application server, you can write your own "
"applications. Tarantoolâ€™s native language for writing applications is `Lua "
"<http://www.lua.org/about.html>`_, so a typical application would be a file "
"that contains your Lua script. But you can also write applications in C or "
"C++."
