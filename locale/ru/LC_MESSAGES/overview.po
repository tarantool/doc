msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tarantool combines an in-memory DBMS and a Lua server in a single platform "
"providing ACID-compliant storage. It comes in two :ref:`editions <overview-"
"editions>`: Community and Enterprise. The :ref:`use cases <overview-"
"use_cases>` for Tarantool vary from ultra-fast cache to product data marts "
"and smart queue services."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here are some of Tarantool's key characteristics:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Easy handling of OLTP workloads**: processes hundreds of thousands RPS"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Data integrity**: :ref:`write-ahead log (WAL) <concepts-data_model-"
"persistence>` and :ref:`data snapshots <concepts-data_model-persistence>`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Cooperative multitasking**: transactions are performed in "
":ref:`lightweight coroutines <concepts-coop_multitasking>` with no "
"interthread locking"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Advanced indexing**: :ref:`composite indexes <concepts-"
"data_model_indexes>`, :ref:`locale support <index-collation>`, indexing by "
":ref:`nested fields and arrays <index-box_indexed-field-types>`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Compute close to data**: :ref:`Lua server <concepts-application_server>` "
"and Just-In-Time compiler on board"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Durable distributed storage**: multiple failover modes and :ref:`RAFT-"
"based synchronous replication <repl_sync>` available"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tarantool allows executing code alongside data, which helps increase the "
"speed of operations. Developers can :ref:`implement any business logic with "
"Lua <app_server-creating_app>`, and a single Tarantool instance can also "
"receive :ref:`SQL requests <sql_tutorial>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tarantool has a variety of compatible `modules "
"<https://www.tarantool.io/en/download/rocks>`__ (Lua rocks). You can pick "
"the ones that you need and install them manually."

"Tarantool runs on Linux (x86_64, aarch64), Mac OS X (x86_64, M1), and "
"FreeBSD (x86_64)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use Tarantool with a programming language you're familiar with. For "
"this purpose, a number of :ref:`connectors <getting_started_connectors>` are"
" provided."

msgid "Editions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tarantool comes in two editions: the open-source **Community Edition (CE)** "
"and the commercial **Enterprise Edition (EE)**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Tarantool Community Edition** lets you develop applications and speed up a"
" system in operation. It features :ref:`synchronous replication "
"<repl_sync>`, affords easy :ref:`scalability <sharding>`, and includes tools"
