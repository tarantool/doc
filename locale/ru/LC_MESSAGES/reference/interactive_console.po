"The \"interactive console\" is Tarantool's basic \"command-line "
"interface\" for entering requests and seeing results. It is what users "
"see when they start the server without an :ref:`instance file <admin-"
"instance_file>`, or start :ref:`tarantoolctl <tarantoolctl>` with "
"``enter``. It is often called the Lua console to distinguish it from the "
"administrative console, but in fact it can handle both Lua and SQL input."
" The majority of examples in this manual show what users see with the "
"interactive console, including the prompt (which can be \"tarantool> \"),"
" the instruction (which can be a Lua request or an SQL statement), and "
"the response (which can be a display in either YAML format or Lua "
"format)."

"The **input language** can be changed to SQL with ``\\set language sql`` "
"or changed to Lua (the default) with ``\\set language lua``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The **delimiter** can be changed to any character with :samp:`\\set "
"delimiter <character>`. The default is nothing, which means input does "
"not need to end with a delimiter. But a common recommendation is to say "
"``set delimiter ;`` especially if input is SQL."

"The **output format** can be changed to Lua with ``\\set output lua`` or "
"changed to YAML (the default) with ``\\set output yaml``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Ordinarily. output from the console has `YAML format "
"<http://yaml.org/spec>`_. That means that there is a line for document-"
"start ``\"---\"``, and each item begins on a separate line starting with "
"``\"- \"``, and each sub-item in a nested structure is indented, and "
"there is a line for document-end ``\"...\"``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Optionally, output from the console can have Lua format. That means that "
"there are no lines for document-start or document-end, and items are not "
"on separate lines (they are only separated by commas), and each sub-item "
"in a nested structure is placed inside \"``{}``\" braces. So, when input "
"is a Lua object description, output will equal input."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"YAML is good for readability. Lua is good for re-using results as "
"requests. A third format, MsgPack, is good for database storage. "
"Currently the default output format is YAML but it may be Lua in a future"
" version, and it may be Lua if the last :ref:`set_default_output "
"<console-set_default_output>` call was "
"``console.set_default_output('lua')``."
