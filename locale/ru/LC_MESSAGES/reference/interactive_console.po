"The interactive console is Tarantool's basic command-line interface for "
"entering requests and seeing results. It is what users see when they start "
"the server without an :ref:`instance file <admin-instance_file>`, or start "
":ref:`tarantoolctl <tarantoolctl>` with ``enter``. The interactive console "
"is often called the Lua console to distinguish it from the administrative "
"console, but in fact it can handle both Lua and SQL input."

"The majority of examples in this manual show what users see with the "
"interactive console, including the prompt (which can be ``tarantool>``), the"
" instruction (which can be a Lua request or an SQL statement), and the "
"response (which can be a display in either YAML format or Lua format)."

"The **delimiter** can be changed to any character with :samp:`\\set "
"delimiter <character>`. The default is nothing, which means input does not "
"need to end with a delimiter. But a common recommendation is to say ``set "
"delimiter ;`` especially if input is SQL."

"Ordinarily. output from the console has `YAML format "
"<http://yaml.org/spec>`_. That means that there is a line for document-start"
" ``\"---\"``, and each item begins on a separate line starting with ``\"- "
"\"``, and each sub-item in a nested structure is indented, and there is a "
"line for document-end ``\"...\"``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Optionally, output from the console can have Lua format. That means that "
"there are no lines for document-start or document-end, and items are not on "
"separate lines (they are only separated by commas), and each sub-item in a "
"nested structure is placed inside \"``{}``\" braces. So, when input is a Lua"
" object description, output will equal input."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"YAML is good for readability. Lua is good for re-using results as requests. "
"A third format, MsgPack, is good for database storage. Currently the default"
" output format is YAML but it may be Lua in a future version, and it may be "
"Lua if the last :ref:`set_default_output <console-set_default_output>` call "
"was ``console.set_default_output('lua')``."
