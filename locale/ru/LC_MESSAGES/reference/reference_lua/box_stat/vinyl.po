msgid "box.stat.vinyl().regulator"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The vinyl regulator decides when to take or delay actions for disk IO, "
"grouping activity in batches so that it is consistent and efficient. The "
"regulator is invoked by the vinyl scheduler, once per second, and updates "
"related variables whenever it is invoked."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``box.stat.vinyl().regulator.dump_bandwidth`` is the estimated average rate "
"at which dumps are done. Initially this will appear as 10485760 (10 "
"megabytes per second). Only significant dumps (larger than one megabyte) are"
" used for estimating."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``box.stat.vinyl().regulator.dump_watermark`` is the point when dumping must"

msgid ""
"``box.stat.vinyl().regulator.write_rate`` is the actual average rate at "
