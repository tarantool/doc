"The :doc:`datetime module </reference/reference_lua/datetime>` enables "
"creating objects of two types: ``datetime`` and ``interval``."

msgid ""
"If you need to shift the ``datetime`` object values, you can use either the "
"modifier methods, that is, the :ref:`:add <datetime-add>` or :ref:`:sub "
"<datetime-sub>` methods, or apply interval arithmetic using overloaded `+ "
"(__add)` or `- (__sub)` methods."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``:add``/``:sub`` modify the current object, but ``+``/``-`` create copy of "
"the object as the operation result."

"In the interval operation, each of the interval subcomponents are "
"sequentially calculated starting from the largest (``year``) to the smallest"

"The sum of two intervals is an interval object, which fields are sum of each"

msgid ""
"The result of subtraction of two intervals is similar: it's an interval "

"fields in the original operands."

"If you add datetime and interval objects, the result is a datetime object. "
"Addition is being performed in a determined order from the largest component"

"Subtraction of two datetime objects produce an interval object. Difference "

" minutes, and seconds."
