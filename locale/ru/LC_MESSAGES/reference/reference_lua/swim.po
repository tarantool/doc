msgid "Overview"
msgstr "Общие сведения"

msgid ""
"The ``swim`` module contains Tarantool's implementation of SWIM -- Scalable "
"Weakly-consistent Infection-style Process Group Membership Protocol. It is "
"recommended for any type of Tarantool cluster where the number of nodes can "
"be large. Its job is to discover and monitor the other members in the "
"cluster and keep their information in a \"member table\". It works by "
"sending and receiving, in a background event loop, periodically, via UDP, "
"messages."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each message has several parts, including:"
msgstr ""

msgid "the ping such as \"I am checking whether you are alive\","
msgstr ""

msgid "the event such as \"I am joining\","
msgstr ""

msgid "the anti-entropy such as \"I know that another member exists\","
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"the payload such as \"I or another member could have user-generated data\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "The maximum message size is about 1500 bytes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"SWIM sends messages periodically to a random subset of the member table. "
"SWIM processes replies from those members asynchronously."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each entry in the member table has:"
msgstr ""

msgid "a UUID,"
msgstr "UUID,"

msgid "a status (\"alive\", \"suspected\", \"dead\", or \"left\")."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a member fails to acknowledge a certain number of pings, its status is "
"changed from \"alive\" to \"suspected\", that is, suspected of being dead. "
"But SWIM tries to **avoid false positives** (misidentifying members as dead)"
" which could happen when a member is overloaded and responds to pings too "
"slowly, or when there is network trouble and packets can not go through some"
" channels. When a member is suspected, SWIM randomly chooses other members "
"and sends requests to them: \"please ping this suspected member\". This is "
"called an **indirect ping**. Thus via different routes and additional hops "
"the suspected member gets additional chances to reply, and thus \"refute\" "
"the suspicion."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because selection is random there is an **even network load** of about one "
"message per member per protocol step, regardless of the cluster size. This "
"is a major feature of SWIM. Because the protocol depends on members passing "
"information on, also known as \"gossiping\", members do not need to "
"broadcast messages to every member, which would cause a network load of N "
"messages per member per protocol step, where N is the number of members in "
"the cluster. However, selection is not entirely random, there is a "
"preference for selecting least-recently-pinged members, like a round-robin."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Regarding the **anti-entropy** part of a message: this is necessary for "
"maintaining the status in entries of the member table. Consider an example "
"where two members, #1 and #2, are both alive. No events happen so only pings"
" are being sent periodically. Then a third member, #3 appears. It knows "
"about one of the existing members, #2. How can it discover the other member?"
" Certainly #1 could notify #2 and #2 could notify #3, but messages go via "
"UDP, so any notification event can be lost. However, regular messages "
"containing \"ping\" and/or \"event\" also can contain an \"anti-entropy\" "
"section, which is taken from a randomly-chosen part of the member table. So "
"for this example, #2 will eventually randomly add to a regular message the "
"anti-entropy note that #1 is alive, and thus #3 will discover #1 even though"
" it did not receive a direct \"I am alive\" event message from #1."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Regarding the **UUID** part of an entry in the member table: this is "
"necessary for stable identification, because UUID changes more rarely than "
"URI (a combination of IP and port number). But if the UUID does change, SWIM"
" will include both the new and old UUID in messages, so all other members "
"will eventually learn about the new UUID and change the member table "
"accordingly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Regarding the **payload** part of a message: this is not always necessary, "
"it is a feature which allows passing user-generated information via SWIM "
"instead of via node-to-node communication. The swim module has methods for "
"specifying a \"payload\", which is arbitrary user data with a maximum size "
"of about 1.2 KB. The payload can be anything, and it will be eventually "
"disseminated over the cluster and available at other members. Each member "
"can have its own payload."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Messages can be **encrypted**. Encryption may not be necessary in a closed "
"network but is necessary for safety if the cluster is on the public "
"Internet. Users can specify an encryption algorithm, an encryption mode, and"
" a private key. All parts of all messages (including ping, acknowledgment, "
"event, payload, URI, and UUID) will be encrypted with that private key, as "
"well as a random public key generated for each message to prevent pattern "
"attacks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In theory the event dissemination speed (the number of hops to pass "
"information throughout the cluster) is ``O(log(cluster_size))``. For that "
"and other theoretical information see the Cornell University `paper "
"<https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/Quicksilver/public_pdfs/SWIM.pdf>`_ "
"which originally described SWIM."

":ref:`incarnation <swim-incarnation_description>`. Usually generation is not"
" specified because the default value (a timestamp) is sufficient, but if "
"there is reason to mistrust timestamps (because the time is changed or "
"because the instance is started on a different machine), then users may say "
"``swim.new({generation = <number>})``. In that case the latest value "
"should be persisted somehow (for example in a file, or in a space, or in a "
"global service), and the new value must be greater than any previous value "
