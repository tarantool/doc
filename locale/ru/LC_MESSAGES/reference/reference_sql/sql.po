msgid ""
"Tarantool's SQL is a major new feature that was first introduced with "
"Tarantool version 2.1. |br| The primary advantages are: |br| - a high "
"level of SQL compatibility |br| - an easy way to switch from NoSQL to SQL"
" and back |br| - the Tarantool brand."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"high level of SQL compatibility\" includes support for joins, "
"subqueries, triggers, indexes, groupings, transactions in a multi-user "
"environment, and conformance with the majority of the mandatory "
"requirements of the SQL:2016 standard."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"easy way to switch\" consists of the fact that the same tables can "
"be operated on with SQL and with the  long-established Tarantool-NoSQL "
"product, meaning that when you want standard Relational-DBMS jobs you can"
" do them, and when you want NoSQL capability you can have it (Tarantool-"
"NoSQL outperforms other NoSQL products in public benchmarks)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"Tarantool brand\" comes from the support of a multi-billion-dollar "
"internet / mail / social-network provider, a dozens-of-professionals "
"staff of programmers and support people, a community who believes in "
"open-source BSD licensing, and hundreds of corporations / government "
"bodies using Tarantool products in production already."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The status of Tarantool's SQL feature is \"release\". So, it is working "
"now and you can verify that by downloading it and trying all the "
"features, which we will explain in the rest of this document. There is "
"also a :ref:`tutorial <sql_tutorial>`."

msgid "Differences from other products"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Differences from other SQL products: We believe that Tarantool's SQL "
"conforms to the majority of the listed mandatory requirements of the core"
" SQL:2016 standard, and we enumerate the specific conformance statements "
"in the feature list in a section about :ref:`\"compliance with the "
"official SQL standard\" <sql>`. We believe that the deviations which most"
" people will find notable are: type checking is less strict, and some "
"data definition options must be done with NoSQL syntax."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Differences from other NoSQL products: We have examined attempts by "
"others to paste relatively smaller subsets of SQL onto NoSQL products, "
"and concluded that Tarantool's SQL has demonstrably more features and "
"capabilities. The reason is that we started with a complete code base of "
"a working SQL DBMS and made it work with Tarantool-NoSQL underneath, "
"rather than starting with a NoSQL DBMS and adding syntax to it."

"The following five parts of this document are: |br| The :ref:`SQL "
"Beginners' Guide <sql_beginners_guide>` explains the basics of relational"
" database management and SQL in particular. |br| The :ref:`SQL User Guide"
" <sql_user_guide>` explains \"How to get Started\" and explains the terms"
" and the syntax elements that apply for all SQL statements. |br| The "
":ref:`SQL Statements and Clauses <sql_statements_and_clauses>` guide "
"explains, for each SQL statement, the format and the rules and the "
"exceptions and the examples and the limitations. |br| The :ref:`SQL Plus "
"Lua <sql_plus_lua>` guide has the details about calling Lua from SQL, "
"calling SQL from Lua, and using the same database objects in both SQL and"
" Lua. |br| The :ref:`SQL Features <sql>` list shows how the product "
"conforms with the mandatory features of the SQL standard."
