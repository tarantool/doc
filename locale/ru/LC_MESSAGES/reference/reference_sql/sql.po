msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tarantool's SQL is a major new feature that was first introduced with "
"Tarantool version 2.1. |br| The primary advantages are: |br| - a high level "
"of SQL compatibility |br| - an easy way to switch from NoSQL to SQL and back"
" |br| - the Tarantool brand."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"high level of SQL compatibility\" includes support for joins, "
"subqueries, triggers, indexes, groupings, transactions in a multi-user "
"environment, and conformance with the majority of the mandatory requirements"
" of the SQL:2016 standard."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"easy way to switch\" consists of the fact that the same tables can be "
"operated on with SQL and with the  long-established Tarantool-NoSQL product,"
" meaning that when you want standard Relational-DBMS jobs you can do them, "
"and when you want NoSQL capability you can have it (Tarantool-NoSQL "
"outperforms other NoSQL products in public benchmarks)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"Tarantool brand\" comes from the support of a multi-billion-dollar "
"internet / mail / social-network provider, a dozens-of-professionals staff "
"of programmers and support people, a community who believes in open-source "
"BSD licensing, and hundreds of corporations / government bodies using "
"Tarantool products in production already."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The status of Tarantool's SQL feature is \"release\". So, it is working now "
"and you can verify that by downloading it and trying all the features, which"
" will be explained in the rest of this document. There is also a "
":ref:`tutorial <sql_tutorial>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Differences from other products"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Differences from other SQL products: The Tarantool design requirement is "
"that Tarantool's SQL conforms to the majority of the listed mandatory "
"requirements of the core SQL:2016 standard, and this will be shown in the "
"specific conformance statements in the feature list in a section about "
":ref:`\"compliance with the official SQL standard\" <sql>`. Possibly the "
"deviations which most people will find notable are: type checking is less "
"strict, and some data definition options must be done with NoSQL syntax."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Differences from other NoSQL products: By examining attempts by others to "
"paste relatively smaller subsets of SQL onto NoSQL products, it should be "
"possible to conclude that Tarantool's SQL has demonstrably more features and"
" capabilities. The reason is that the Tarantool developers started with a "
"complete code base of a working SQL DBMS and made it work with Tarantool-"
"NoSQL underneath, rather than starting with a NoSQL DBMS and adding syntax "
"to it."
