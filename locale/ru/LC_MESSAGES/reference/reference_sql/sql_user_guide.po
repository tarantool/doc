msgstr ""

msgid "Tarantool has a \"schema\". A schema is a container for all database objects. A schema may be called a \"database\" in other DBMS implementations"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tarantool allows four types of \"database objects\" to be created within the schema: tables, triggers, indexes, and constraints. Within tables, there are \"columns\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Almost all Tarantool SQL statements begin with a reserved-word \"verb\" such as INSERT, and end optionally with a semicolon. For example: ``INSERT INTO t VALUES (1);``"
msgstr ""

msgid "A Tarantool SQL database and a Tarantool NoSQL database are the same thing. However, some operations are only possible with SQL, and others are only possible with NoSQL. Mixing SQL statements with NoSQL requests is allowed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tokens"
msgstr ""

msgid "The token is the minimum SQL-syntax unit that Tarantool understands. These are the types of tokens:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Keywords -- official words in the language, for example ``SELECT`` |br| Literals -- constants for numbers or strings, for example ``15.7`` or ``'Taranto'`` |br| Identifiers -- for example column55 or table_of_accounts |br| Operators (strictly speaking \"non-alphabetic operators\") -- for example ``* / + - ( ) , ; < = >=``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tokens can be separated from each other by one or more separators: |br| * White space characters: tab (U+0009), line feed (U+000A), vertical tab (U+000B), form feed (U+000C), carriage return (U+000D), space (U+0020), next line (U+0085), and all the rare characters in Unicode classes Zl and Zp and Zs. For a full list see https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2371. |br| * Bracketed comments (beginning with ``/*`` and ending with ``*/``) |br| * Simple comments (beginning with ``--`` and ending with line feed) |br| Separators are not necessary before or after operators. |br| Separators are necessary after keywords or numbers or ordinary identifiers, unless the following token is an operator. |br| Thus Tarantool can understand this series of six tokens: |br| ``SELECT'a'FROM/**/t;`` |br| but for readability one would usually use spaces to separate tokens: |br| ``SELECT 'a' FROM /**/ t;``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Literals"
msgstr ""

msgid "There are five kinds of literals: BOOLEAN INTEGER DOUBLE STRING VARBINARY."
msgstr ""

msgid "BOOLEAN literals:  |br| TRUE | FALSE | UNKNOWN |br| A literal has :ref:`data type = BOOLEAN <sql_data_type_boolean>` if it is the keyword TRUE or FALSE. UNKNOWN is a synonym for NULL. A literal may have type = BOOLEAN if it is the keyword NULL and there is no context to indicate a different data type."
msgstr ""

msgid "INTEGER literals: |br| [plus-sign | minus-sign] digit [digit ...] |br| or, for a hexadecimal integer literal, |br| [plus-sign | minus-sign] 0X | 0x hexadecimal-digit [hexadecimal-digit ...] |br| Examples: 5, -5, +5, 55555, 0X55, 0x55 |br| Hexadecimal 0X55 is equal to decimal 85. A literal has :ref:`data type = INTEGER <sql_data_type_integer>` if it contains only digits and is in the range  -9223372036854775808 to +18446744073709551615, integers outside that range are illegal."
msgstr ""

msgid "DOUBLE literals: |br| [plus-sign | minus-sign] [digit [digit ...]] period [digit [digit ...]] |br| [E|e [plus-sign | minus-sign] digit ...] |br| Examples: .0, 1.0, 1E5, 1.1E5. |br| A literal has :ref:`data type = DOUBLE <sql_data_type_double>` if it contains a period, or contains \"E\". DOUBLE literals are also known as floating-point literals or approximate-numeric literals. To represent \"Inf\" (infinity), write a real number outside the double-precision number range, for example 1E309. To represent \"nan\" (not a number), write an expression that does not result in a real number, for example 0/0, using Tarantool/NoSQL. This will appear as NULL in Tarantool/SQL. In an earlier version literals containing periods were considered to be :ref:`NUMBER <sql_data_type_number>` literals. In a future version \"nan\" may not appear as NULL."
msgstr ""

msgid "STRING literals: |br| [quote] [character ...] [quote] |br| Examples: ``'ABC'``, ``'AB''C'`` |br| A literal has :ref:`data type type = STRING <sql_data_type_string>` if it is a sequence of zero or more characters enclosed in single quotes. The sequence ``''``  (two single quotes in a row) is treated as ``'`` (a single quote) when enclosed in quotes, that is, ``'A''B'`` is interpreted as ``A'B``."
msgstr ""

msgid "VARBINARY literals: |br| X|x [quote] [hexadecimal-digit-pair ...] [quote] |br| Example: ``X'414243'``, which will be displayed as ``'ABC'``. |br| A literal has :ref:`data type = VARBINARY <sql_data_type_varbinary>` (\"variable-length binary\") if it is the letter X followed by quotes containing pairs of hexadecimal digits, representing byte values."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here are four ways to put non-ASCII characters,such as the Greek letter α alpha,  in string literals: |br| First make sure that your shell program is set to accept characters as UTF-8. A simple way to check is |br| ``SELECT hex('α');`` If the result is CEB1 -- which is the hexadecimal value for the UTF-8 representation of α -- it is good. |br| (1) Simply enclose the character inside ``'...'``, |br| ``'α'`` |br| or |br| (2) Find out what is the hexadecimal code for the UTF-8 representation of α, and enclose that inside ``X'...'``, then cast to STRING because ``X'...'`` literals are data type VARBINARY not STRING, |br| ``CAST(X'CEB1' AS STRING)`` |br| or |br| (3) Find out what is the Unicode code point for α, and pass that to the :ref:`CHAR function <sql_function_char>`. |br| ``CHAR(945)  /* remember that this is α as data type STRING not VARBINARY */`` |br| (4) Enclose statements inside double quotes and include Lua escapes, for example ``box.execute(\"SELECT '\\206\\177';\")`` |br| One can use the concatenation operator ``||`` to combine characters made with any of these methods."
msgstr ""

msgid "Limitations: (`Issue#2344 <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues/2344>`_) |br| * Numeric literals may be quoted, one cannot depend on the presence or absence of quote marks to determine whether a literal is numeric. |br| * ``LENGTH('A''B') = 3`` which is correct, but the display from ``SELECT A''B;`` is ``A''B``, which is misleading. |br| * It is unfortunate that ``X'41'`` is a byte sequence which looks the same as ``'A'``, but it is not the same. ``box.execute(\"select 'A' < X'41';\")`` is not legal at the moment. This happens because ``TYPEOF(X'41')`` yields ``'varbinary'``. Also it is illegal to say ``UPDATE ... SET string_column = X'41'``, one must say ``UPDATE ... SET string_column = CAST(X'41' AS STRING);``. |br| * It is non-standard to say that any number which contains a period has data type = DOUBLE."
msgstr ""

msgid "Identifiers"
msgstr ""

msgid "All database objects -- tables, triggers, indexes, columns, constraints, functions, collations -- have identifiers. An identifier should begin with a letter or underscore (``'_'``) and should contain only letters, digits, dollar signs (``'$'``), or underscores. The maximum number of bytes in an identifier is between 64982 and 65000. For compatibility reasons, Tarantool recommends that an identifier should not have more than 30 characters."
msgstr ""

msgid "Letters in identifiers do not have to come from the Latin alphabet, for example the Japanese syllabic ひ and the Cyrillic letter д are legal. But be aware that a Latin letter needs only one byte but a Cyrillic letter needs two bytes, so Cyrillic identifiers consume a tiny amount more space."
msgstr ""

msgid "Reserved words"
msgstr ""

msgid "Certain words are reserved and should not be used for identifiers. The simple rule is: if a word means something in Tarantool SQL syntax, do not try to use it for an identifier. The current list of reserved words is:"

msgstr ""

msgid "Identifiers may be enclosed in double quotes. These are called quoted identifiers or \"delimited identifiers\" (unquoted identifiers may be called \"regular identifiers\"). The double quotes are not part of the identifier. A delimited identifier may be a reserved word and may contain any printable character. Tarantool converts letters in regular identifiers to upper case before it accesses the database, so for statements like ``CREATE TABLE a (a INTEGER PRIMARY KEY);`` or ``SELECT a FROM a;`` the table name is A and the column name is A. However, Tarantool does not convert delimited identifiers to upper case, so for statements like ``CREATE TABLE \"a\" (\"a\" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY);`` or ``SELECT \"a\" FROM \"a\";`` the table name is a and the column name is a. The sequence ``\"\"`` is treated as ``\"`` when enclosed in double quotes, that is, ``\"A\"\"B\"`` is interpreted as ``\"A\"B\"``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Examples: things, t45, journal_entries_for_2017, ддд, ``\"into\"``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Inside certain statements, identifiers may have \"qualifiers\" to prevent ambiguity. A qualifier is an identifier of a higher-level object, followed by a period. For example column1 within table1 may be referred to as table1.column1. The \"name\" of an object is the same as its identifier, or its qualified identifier. For example, inside ``SELECT t1.column1, t2.column1 FROM t1, t2;`` the qualifiers make it clear that the first column is column1 from table1 and the second column is column2 from table2."
msgstr ""

msgid "The rules are sometimes relaxed for compatibility reasons, for example some non-letter characters such as $ and « are legal in regular identifiers. However, it is better to assume that rules are never relaxed."
msgstr ""

msgid "The following are examples of legal and illegal identifiers."
msgstr ""

msgid "_A1   -- legal, begins with underscore and contains underscore | letter | digit\n"
"1_A   -- illegal, begins with digit\n"
"A$« -- legal, but not recommended, try to stick with digits and letters and underscores\n"
"+ -- illegal, operator token\n"
"grant -- illegal, GRANT is a reserved word\n"
"\"grant\" -- legal, delimited identifiers may be reserved words\n"
"\"_space\" -- legal, but Tarantool already uses this name for a system space\n"
"\"A\".\"X\" -- legal, for columns only, inside statements where qualifiers may be necessary\n"
"'a' -- illegal, single quotes are for literals not identifiers\n"
"A123456789012345678901234567890 -- legal, identifiers can be long\n"
"ддд -- legal, and will be converted to upper case in identifiers"

msgid "Operands"
msgstr ""

msgid "An operand is something that can be operated on. Literals and column identifiers are operands. So are NULL and DEFAULT."
msgstr ""

msgid "NULL and DEFAULT are keywords which represent values whose data types are not known until they are assigned or compared, so they are known by the technical term \"contextually typed value specifications\". (Exception: for the non-standard statement \"SELECT NULL FROM table-name;\"  NULL has data type BOOLEAN.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Operand data types"
msgstr ""

msgid "Every operand has a data type."
msgstr ""

msgid "For literals, :ref:`as we saw earlier <sql_literals>`, the data type is usually determined by the format."
msgstr ""

msgid "For identifiers, the data type is usually determined by the definition."
msgstr ""

msgid "The usual determination may change because of context or because of :ref:`explicit casting <sql_function_cast>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "For some SQL data type names there are *aliases*. An alias may be used for data definition. For example VARCHAR(5) and TEXT are aliases of STRING and may appear in :samp:`CREATE TABLE {table_name} ({column_name} VARCHAR(5) PRIMARY KEY);` but Tarantool, if asked, will report that the data type of :samp:`{column_name}` is STRING."
