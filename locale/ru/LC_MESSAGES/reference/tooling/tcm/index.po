"|tcm_full_name| (|tcm|) is a web-based visual tool for configuring, "
"managing, and monitoring Tarantool EE clusters. It provides a GUI for "
"working with clusters and individual instances, from monitoring their state "
"to executing commands interactively in an instance's console."

"|tcm| is a standalone application included in the Tarantool Enterprise "
"Edition :ref:`distribution package <enterprise-package-contents>`. It is "

"|tcm| works only with Tarantool EE clusters that use :ref:`etcd as a "
"configuration storage <configuration_etcd>`. When you create or edit a "
"cluster's configuration in |tcm|, it publishes the saved configuration to "
"etcd. This ensures consistent and reliable configuration storage. A single "
"|tcm| installation can connect to multiple Tarantool EE clusters and switch "
"between them in one click."

"To provide enterprise-grade security, |tcm| features its own role-based "
"access control. You can create users and assign them roles that include "
"required permissions. For example, a user can be an administrator of a "
"specific cluster or only have the right to read data. LDAP authorization is "
"supported as well."
