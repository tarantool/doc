msgid ""
"|tcm_full_name| is a part of the `Enterprise Edition "
"<https://www.tarantool.io/compare/>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"|tcm_full_name| features a role-based access control system. It enables "
"flexible management of access to |tcm| functions, connected clusters, and "
"stored data. The |tcm| access system uses three main entities: permissions, "
"roles, and users (or user accounts). They work as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Permissions correspond to specific functions or objects in |tcm| "
"(*administrative permissions*) or operations on clusters (*cluster "
"permissions*)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Roles are predefined sets of *administrative* permissions to assign to "
"users."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Users have roles that define their access rights to |tcm| functions and "
"objects, and *cluster* permissions that are assigned for each cluster "
"separately."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"|tcm| users, roles, and permissions are not to be confused with similar "
"subjects of the :ref:`Tarantool access control system <authentication>`. To "
"access Tarantool instances directly, Tarantool users with corresponding "
"roles are required."
msgstr ""

msgid "Permissions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Permissions define access to specific actions that users can do in |tcm|. "
"For example, there are permissions to view connected clusters or to manage "
"users."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are two types of permissions in |tcm|: *administrative* and *cluster* "
"permissions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Administrative permissions* provide access to |tcm| functions. They define "
"which pages and controls are available to users in the web UI. Typically, "
"*read* permissions define pages shown in the left menu. *Write* permissions "
"define the availability of controls for managing objects on the pages. For "
"example, users with read permission to clusters can view the **Clusters** "
"page but they don't see **Add**, **Edit**, or **Remove** buttons unless they"
" have the write permission."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Administrative permissions are assigned to users through :ref:`roles "
"<tcm_access_control_roles>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Cluster permissions* enable actions with connected Tarantool clusters. "
"These permissions are granted to users on a per-cluster level: each user has"
" a separate set of permissions for each cluster."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Cluster permissions define which pages of the **Cluster** menu section users"
" see and what actions they can take on these pages. For example, users with "
"the read configuration permission to a cluster configuration see the "
"**Configuration** page when this cluster is selected."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Cluster permissions are assigned to users individually when creating or "
"editing them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Permissions are predefined in |tcm|, there is no way to change, add, or "
"delete them. The complete lists of administrative and cluster permissions in"
" |tcm| are provided in the :ref:`Permissions reference "
"<tcm_access_control_permissions_ref>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Roles"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Roles are groups of :ref:`administrative permissions "
"<tcm_access_control_permissions>` that are assigned to users together."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The assigned roles define pages that users see in |tcm| and actions "
"available on these pages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Roles don't include cluster permissions. Access to connected clusters is "
"configured for each user individually."
msgstr ""

msgid "Default roles"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"|tcm| comes with default roles that cover three common usage scenarios:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Super Admin Role** is a default role with all available "
":ref:`administrative permissions <tcm_access_control_permissions_admin>`. "
"Additionally, the users with this role automatically gain all :ref:`cluster "
"permissions <tcm_access_control_permissions_cluster>` to all clusters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Cluster Admin Role** is a default role for cluster administration. It "
"includes administrative permissions for cluster management."
msgstr ""
