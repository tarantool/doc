msgstr ""

msgid "Connect an existing cluster."

msgid ""
"Add a new cluster and :ref:`write its configuration <tcm_cluster_config>` "

msgid "Connection parameters"
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Configuration storage connection"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The cluster configuration can be stored in either an :ref:`etcd "

msgid ""
"A key prefix used to identify the cluster in the configuration storage. A "

"Additionally, if SSL or TLS encryption is enabled for the configuration "
"storage, provide the corresponding encryption configuration: keys, "
