"``tt play`` plays operations from ``.xlog`` and ``.snap`` files to the "
"destination instance one by one. All data changes happen the same way as if "
"they were performed on this instance. This means that:"

"All affected spaces must exist on the destination instance. They must have "
"the same structure and ``space_id`` as on the instance that created the "
"snapshot or WAL file."

msgid ""
"To play a snapshot or a WAL to a clean instance, include the operations on "
"system spaces by adding the ``--show-system`` flag. With this flag, ``tt`` "
"plays the operations that create and configure user-defined spaces."
