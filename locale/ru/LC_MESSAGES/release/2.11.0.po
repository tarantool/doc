msgid "Security enforcement options"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With 2.11, Tarantool Enterprise Edition includes new security enforcement "
"options. These options enable you to enforce the use of strong passwords, "
"set up a maximum password age, and so on. For example, the "
"``password_min_length`` configuration option specifies the minimum number of"
" characters for a password:"
msgstr ""

msgid "box.cfg{ password_min_length = 10 }"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To specify the maximum period of time (in days) a user can use the same "
"password, you can use the ``password_lifetime_days`` option, which uses the "
"system clock under the hood:"
msgstr ""

msgid "box.cfg{ password_lifetime_days = 365 }"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that by default, new options are not specified. You can learn more "
"about all the available options from the :ref:`Authentication restrictions "
"<enterprise-auth-restrictions>` and :ref:`Password policy <enterprise-"
"password-policy>` sections."
msgstr ""

msgid "PAP-SHA256 authentication method"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, Tarantool uses the CHAP protocol to authenticate users and "
"applies SHA-1 hashing to passwords. In this case, password hashes are stored"
" in the ``_user`` space unsalted. If an attacker gains access to the "
"database, they may crack a password, for example, using a rainbow table."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With the Enterprise Edition, you can enable PAP authentication with the "
"SHA256 hashing algorithm. For PAP, a password is salted with a user-unique "
"salt before saving it in the database."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Given that PAP transmits a password as plain text, Tarantool requires "
"configuring :ref:`SSL/TLS <enterprise-iproto-encryption-config>`. Then, you "
"need to specify the ``box.cfg.auth_type`` option as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid "box.cfg{ auth_type = 'pap-sha256' }"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Learn more from the :ref:`Authentication protocol <enterprise-"
"authentication-protocol>` section."
msgstr ""

msgid "Read views"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Starting with 2.11, Tarantool Enterprise Edition provides the ability to "
"create read views - in-memory snapshots of the entire database that aren't "
"affected by future data modifications. Read views can be used to make "
"complex analytical queries. This reduces the load on the main database and "
"improves RPS for a single Tarantool instance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Working with read views consists of three main steps:"
msgstr ""

msgid "To create a read view, call the ``box.read_view.open()`` function:"
msgstr ""

msgid "tarantool> read_view1 = box.read_view.open({name = 'read_view1'})"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After creating a read view, you can access database spaces and their indexes"
" and get data using the familiar ``select`` and ``pairs`` data-retrieval "
"operations, for example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"tarantool> read_view1.space.bands:select({}, {limit = 4})\n"
"---\n"
"- - [1, 'Roxette', 1986]\n"
"  - [2, 'Scorpions', 1965]\n"
"  - [3, 'Ace of Base', 1987]\n"
"  - [4, 'The Beatles', 1960]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a read view is no longer needed, close it using the "
"``read_view_object:close()`` method:"
msgstr ""

msgid "tarantool> read_view1:close()"
msgstr ""

msgid "To learn more, see the :ref:`Read views <read_views>` topic."
msgstr ""

msgid "Data compression improvements"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tarantool Enterprise Edition now includes the ``zlib`` algorithm for "
":ref:`tuple compression <tuple_compression>`. This algorithm shows good "
"performance in data decompression, which reduces CPU usage if the volume of "
"read operations significantly exceeds the volume of write operations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To use the new algorithm, set the ``compression`` option to ``zlib`` when "
"formatting a space:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"box.space.my_space:format{\n"
"    {name = 'id', type = 'unsigned'},\n"
"    {name = 'data', type = 'string', compression = 'zlib'},\n"
"}"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The new :ref:`compress <compress-module>` module provides an API for "
"compressing and decompressing arbitrary data strings using the same "
"algorithms available for tuple compression:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"compressor = require('compress.zlib').new()\n"
"\n"
"data = compressor:compress('Hello world!') -- returns a binary string\n"
"compressor:decompress(data) -- returns 'Hello world!'"
msgstr ""

msgid "WAL extensions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tarantool can use a write-ahead log not only to maintain data persistence "
"and replication. Another use case is implementing a CDC (Change Data "
"Capture) utility that transforms a data replication stream and provides the "
"ability to replicate data from Tarantool to an external storage."
msgstr ""

msgid "Write-ahead log extensions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With 2.11, Tarantool Enterprise Edition provides WAL extensions that add "
"auxiliary information to each write-ahead log record. For example, you can "
"enable storing old and new tuples for each write-ahead log record. This is "
"especially useful for the ``update`` operation because a write-ahead log "
"record contains only a key value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See the :ref:`WAL extensions <wal_extensions>` topic to learn how to enable "
"and configure WAL extensions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Community Edition"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pagination"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With the 2.11 version, Tarantool supports pagination and enables the ability"
" to get data in chunks. The :ref:`index_object:select() <box_index-select>` "
"and :ref:`index_object:pairs() <box_index-pairs>` methods now provide the "
"``after`` option that specifies a tuple or a tuple's position after which "
"``select`` starts the search. In the example below, the ``select`` operation"
" gets maximum 3 tuples after the specified tuple:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"tarantool> bands.index.primary:select({}, {after = {4, 'The Beatles', 1960}, limit = 3})\n"
"---\n"
"- - [5, 'Pink Floyd', 1965]\n"
"  - [6, 'The Rolling Stones', 1962]\n"
"  - [7, 'The Doors', 1965]\n"
"..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``after`` option also accepts the position of the tuple represented by "
"the base64 string. For example, you can set the ``fetch_pos`` boolean option"
" to ``true`` to return the position of the last selected tuple as the second"
" value:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"tarantool> result, position = bands.index.primary:select({}, {limit = 3, fetch_pos = true})\n"
"---\n"
"..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Then, pass this position as the ``after`` parameter:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"tarantool> bands.index.primary:select({}, {limit = 3, after = position})\n"
"---\n"
"- - [4, 'The Beatles', 1960]\n"
"  - [5, 'Pink Floyd', 1965]\n"
"  - [6, 'The Rolling Stones', 1962]\n"
"..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The new ``after`` and ``fetch_pos`` options are also implemented by the "
"built-in ``net.box`` connector. For example, you can use these options to "
"get data :ref:`asynchronously <net_box-is_async>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Downgrading a database"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The 2.11 version provides the ability to downgrade a database to the "
"specified Tarantool version using the :ref:`box.schema.downgrade() "
"<box_schema-downgrade>` method. This might be useful in the case of a failed"
" upgrade."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To prepare a database for using it on an older Tarantool instance, call "
"``box.schema.downgrade`` and pass the desired Tarantool version:"
msgstr ""

msgid "tarantool> box.schema.downgrade('2.8.4')"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To see Tarantool versions available for downgrade, call "
"``box.schema.downgrade_versions()``. The earliest release available for "
"downgrade is :doc:`2.8.2 </release/2.8.2>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "New bootstrap strategy"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In previous Tarantool versions, the :ref:`replication_connect_quorum "
"<cfg_replication-replication_connect_quorum>` option was used to specify the"
" number of running nodes to start a replica set. This option was designed to"
" simplify a replica set bootstrap. But in fact, this behavior brought some "
"issues during a cluster lifetime and maintenance operations, for example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Users who didn't change this option encountered problems with the partial "
"cluster bootstrap."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Users who changed the option encountered problems during the instance "
"restart."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With 2.11, ``replication_connect_quorum`` is deprecated in favor of "
":ref:`bootstrap_strategy <cfg_replication-bootstrap_strategy>`. This option "
"works during a replica set bootstrap and implies sensible default values for"
" other parameters based on the replica set configuration. Currently, "
"``bootstrap_strategy`` accepts two values:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``auto``: a node doesn't boot if half or more of the other nodes in a "
"replica set are not connected. For example, if the replication parameter "
"contains 2 or 3 nodes, a node requires 2 connected instances. In the case of"
" 4 or 5 nodes, at least 3 connected instances are required. Moreover, a "
"bootstrap leader fails to boot unless every connected node has chosen it as "
"a bootstrap leader."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``legacy``: a node requires the ``replication_connect_quorum`` number of "
"other nodes to be connected. This option is added to keep the compatibility "
"with the current versions of Cartridge and might be removed in the future."
msgstr ""

msgid "Limitation of fiber execution time"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Starting with 2.11, if a fiber works too long without yielding control, you "
"can use a fiber slice to limit its execution time. The "
":ref:`fiber_slice_default <compat-option-fiber-slice>` ``compat`` option "
"controls the default value of the maximum fiber slice. In future versions, "
"this option will be set to ``true`` by default."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are two slice types - a warning and an error slice:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a warning slice is over, a warning message is logged, for example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "fiber has not yielded for more than 0.500 seconds"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When an error slice is over, the fiber is cancelled and the "
"``FiberSliceIsExceeded`` error is thrown:"
msgstr ""

msgid "FiberSliceIsExceeded: fiber slice is exceeded"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that these messages can point at issues in the existing application "
"code. These issues can cause potential problems in production."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The fiber slice is checked by all functions operating on spaces and indexes,"
" such as ``index_object.select()``, ``space_object.replace()``, and so on. "
"You can also use the ``fiber.check_slice()`` function in application code to"
" check whether the slice for the current fiber is over."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The example below shows how to use ``fiber.set_max_slice()`` to limit the "
"slice for all fibers. ``fiber.check_slice()`` is called inside a long-"
"running operation to determine whether a slice for the current fiber is "
"over."
msgstr ""
