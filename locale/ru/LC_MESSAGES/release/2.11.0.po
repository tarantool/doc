msgid ""
"With 2.11, Tarantool Enterprise includes new security enforcement options. "
"These options enable you to enforce the use of strong passwords, set up a "
"maximum password age, and so on. For example, the ``password_min_length`` "
"configuration option specifies the minimum number of characters for a "
"password:"
msgstr ""

msgid "box.cfg{ password_min_length = 10 }"

"sections."
msgstr ""

msgid "PAP-SHA256 authentication method"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, Tarantool uses the CHAP protocol to authenticate users and "
"applies SHA-1 hashing to passwords. In this case, password hashes are stored"
" in the ``_user`` space unsalted. If an attacker gains access to the "
"database, they may crack a password, for example, using a rainbow table."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With Tarantool Enterprise, you can enable PAP authentication with the SHA256"
" hashing algorithm. For PAP, a password is salted with a user-unique salt "
"before saving it in the database."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Given that PAP transmits a password as plain text, Tarantool requires "
"configuring `SSL/TLS "
"<https://www.tarantool.io/en/enterprise_doc/security/#enterprise-iproto-"
"encryption-config>`_. Then, you need to specify the ``box.cfg.auth_type`` "
"option as follows:"

msgid "Read views"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Starting with 2.11, Tarantool Enterprise provides the ability to create read"
" views - in-memory snapshots of the entire database that aren't affected by "
"future data modifications. Read views can be used to make complex analytical"
" queries. This reduces the load on the main database and improves RPS for a "
"single Tarantool instance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Working with read views consists of three main steps:"
msgstr ""

msgid "To create a read view, call the ``box.read_view.open()`` function:"
msgstr ""

msgid "tarantool> read_view1 = box.read_view.open({name = 'read_view1'})"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After creating a read view, you can access database spaces and their indexes"
" and get data using the familiar ``select`` and ``pairs`` data-retrieval "
"operations, for example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"tarantool> read_view1.space.bands:select({}, {limit = 4})\n"
"---\n"
"- - [1, 'Roxette', 1986]\n"
"  - [2, 'Scorpions', 1965]\n"
"  - [3, 'Ace of Base', 1987]\n"
"  - [4, 'The Beatles', 1960]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a read view is no longer needed, close it using the "
"``read_view_object:close()`` method:"
msgstr ""

msgid "tarantool> read_view1:close()"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To learn more, see the `Read views "
"<https://www.tarantool.io/en/enterprise_doc/read_views/>`_ topic."
msgstr ""

msgid "Data compression improvements"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tarantool Enterprise now includes the ``zlib`` algorithm for `tuple "
"compression "
"<https://www.tarantool.io/en/enterprise_doc/tuple_compression/>`_. This "
"algorithm shows good performance in data decompression, which reduces CPU "
"usage if the volume of read operations significantly exceeds the volume of "
"write operations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To use the new algorithm, set the ``compression`` option to ``zlib`` when "
"formatting a space:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"box.space.my_space:format{\n"
"    {name = 'id', type = 'unsigned'},\n"
"    {name = 'data', type = 'string', compression = 'zlib'},\n"
"}"

msgid ""
"The new ``compress`` module provides an API for compressing and "
"decompressing arbitrary data strings using the same algorithms available for"
" tuple compression:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"compressor = require('compress.zlib').new()\n"
"\n"
"data = compressor:compress('Hello world!') -- returns a binary string\n"
"compressor:decompress(data) -- returns 'Hello world!'"
msgstr ""

msgid "WAL extensions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tarantool can use a write-ahead log not only to maintain data persistence "
"and replication. Another use case is implementing a CDC (Change Data "
"Capture) utility that transforms a data replication stream and provides the "
"ability to replicate data from Tarantool to an external storage."
msgstr ""

msgid "Write-ahead log extensions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With 2.11, Tarantool Enterprise provides WAL extensions that add auxiliary "
"information to each write-ahead log record. For example, you can enable "
"storing old and new tuples for each write-ahead log record. This is "
"especially useful for the ``update`` operation because a write-ahead log "
"record contains only a key value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See the `WAL extensions "
"<https://www.tarantool.io/en/enterprise_doc/wal_extensions/>`_ topic to "
"learn how to enable and configure WAL extensions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tarantool Community"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pagination"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With the 2.11 version, Tarantool supports pagination and enables the ability"
" to get data in chunks. The :ref:`index_object:select() <box_index-select>` "
"and :ref:`index_object:pairs() <box_index-pairs>` methods now provide the "
"``after`` option that specifies a tuple or a tuple's position after which "
"``select`` starts the search. In the example below, the ``select`` operation"
" gets maximum 3 tuples after the specified tuple:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"tarantool> bands.index.primary:select({}, {after = {4, 'The Beatles', 1960}, limit = 3})\n"
"---\n"

"  - [6, 'The Rolling Stones', 1962]\n"
"  - [7, 'The Doors', 1965]\n"
"..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``after`` option also accepts the position of the tuple represented by "
"the base64 string. For example, you can set the ``fetch_pos`` boolean option"
" to ``true`` to return the position of the last selected tuple as the second"
" value:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"tarantool> result, position = bands.index.primary:select({}, {limit = 3, fetch_pos = true})\n"
"---\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The new ``after`` and ``fetch_pos`` options are also implemented by the "
"built-in ``net.box`` connector. For example, you can use these options to "
"get data :ref:`asynchronously <net_box-is_async>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Downgrading a database"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The 2.11 version provides the ability to downgrade a database to the "
"specified Tarantool version using the :ref:`box.schema.downgrade() "
"<box_schema-downgrade>` method. This might be useful in the case of a failed"
" upgrade."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To prepare a database for using it on an older Tarantool instance, call "
"``box.schema.downgrade`` and pass the desired Tarantool version:"
msgstr ""

msgid "tarantool> box.schema.downgrade('2.8.4')"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To see Tarantool versions available for downgrade, call "
"``box.schema.downgrade_versions()``. The earliest release available for "
"downgrade is :doc:`2.8.2 </release/2.8.2>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "New bootstrap strategy"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In previous Tarantool versions, the :ref:`replication_connect_quorum "
"<cfg_replication-replication_connect_quorum>` option was used to specify the"
" number of running nodes to start a replica set. This option was designed to"
" simplify a replica set bootstrap. But in fact, this behavior brought some "
"issues during a cluster lifetime and maintenance operations, for example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Users who didn't change this option encountered problems with the partial "
"cluster bootstrap."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Users who changed the option encountered problems during the instance "
"restart."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With 2.11, ``replication_connect_quorum`` is deprecated in favor of "
":ref:`bootstrap_strategy <cfg_replication-bootstrap_strategy>`. This option "
"works during a replica set bootstrap and implies sensible default values for"
" other parameters based on the replica set configuration. Currently, "
"``bootstrap_strategy`` accepts two values:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``auto``: a node doesn't boot if half or more of the other nodes in a "
"replica set are not connected. For example, if the replication parameter "
"contains 2 or 3 nodes, a node requires 2 connected instances. In the case of"
" 4 or 5 nodes, at least 3 connected instances are required. Moreover, a "
"bootstrap leader fails to boot unless every connected node has chosen it as "
"a bootstrap leader."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``legacy``: a node requires the ``replication_connect_quorum`` number of "
"other nodes to be connected. This option is added to keep the compatibility "
"with the current versions of Cartridge and might be removed in the future."
msgstr ""

msgid "Limitation of fiber execution time"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Starting with 2.11, if a fiber works too long without yielding control, you "
"can use a fiber slice to limit its execution time. The "
":ref:`fiber_slice_default <compat-option-fiber-slice>` ``compat`` option "
"controls the default value of the maximum fiber slice. In future versions, "
"this option will be set to ``true`` by default."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are two slice types - a warning and an error slice:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a warning slice is over, a warning message is logged, for example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "fiber has not yielded for more than 0.500 seconds"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When an error slice is over, the fiber is cancelled and the "
"``FiberSliceIsExceeded`` error is thrown:"

msgid "FiberSliceIsExceeded: fiber slice is exceeded"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that these messages can point at issues in the existing application "
"code. These issues can cause potential problems in production."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The fiber slice is checked by all functions operating on spaces and indexes,"
" such as ``index_object.select()``, ``space_object.replace()``, and so on. "
"You can also use the ``fiber.check_slice()`` function in application code to"
" check whether the slice for the current fiber is over."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The example below shows how to use ``fiber.set_max_slice()`` to limit the "
