"``box_session_push()``: a new public C API function. It takes ``const char *"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The module provides popen implementation that is integrated with tarantool’s"
" event loop (like built-in ``fio`` and ``socket`` modules)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It support bidirectional communication with a process: the module can feed "
"input to a process and capture its output. This way it allows to run "
"streaming programs (like ``grep``) and even work interactively with outside "
"REPL (say, ``python -i``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A key feature of the implementation is that it uses vfork() under hood and "
"so does not copy virtual memory tables. Copying of them may be quite time "
"consuming: os.execute() takes ~2.5 seconds when 80 GiB is allocated for "
"memtx. Moreover, when memory overcommit is disabled (which is default) it "
"would be not possible to fork a process when more then half of available "
"physical memory is mapped to tarantool’s process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The API should be considered as beta: it is quite basic and will be extended"
" with convenience features. On the other hand, it may be changed in a "
"backward-incompatible manner in the future releases if it will be valuable "
"enough."
