msgstr ""

msgid "Fixed msgpack extension types decoding error message (gh-5016)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Dropped restrictions on nullable multikey index root. They were introduced "

msgid ""
"Fixed fibers switch-over to prevent JIT machinery misbehavior. Trace "
"recording is aborted when fiber yields the execution. The yield occurring "
"while the compiled code is being run (it’s likely a function with a yield "
"underneath called via LuaJIT FFI) leads to the platform panic (gh-1700, "
"gh-4491)."

"Anonymous replica could be registered and could prevent WAL files removal "
"(gh-5287)."

msgid ""
"XlogGapError is not a critical error anymore. It means, box.info.replication"
" will show upstream status as ‘loading’ if the error was found. The upstream"
