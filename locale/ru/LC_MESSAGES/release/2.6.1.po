msgid "Overview"
msgstr "Общие сведения"

msgid "2.6.1 is the beta version of the 2.6 release series."
msgstr ""

msgid "This release introduces roughly 17 features and resolves 22 bugs since the 2.5.1 version. There may be bugs in less common areas. If you find any, feel free to report an issue at `GitHub <https://github.com/tarantool/tarantool/issues>`__."

msgid "Notable changes are:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Transactional manager for the memtx engine that allows yielding in transactions. It also guarantees the data consistency for synchronous replication, eliminating dirty reads for unconfirmed transactions."

msgid "Compatibility"
msgstr "Совместимость"

msgid "Tarantool 2.x is backward compatible with Tarantool 1.10.x in the binary data layout, client-server protocol, and replication protocol."

msgid "Please `upgrade <https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/latest/book/admin/upgrades/>`__ using the ``box.schema.upgrade()`` procedure to unlock all the new features of the 2.x series."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are changes labeled with **[Breaking change]**. It means that the old behavior was considered error-prone and therefore changed to protect users from unintended mistakes. However, there is a little probability that someone can lean on the old behavior, and this label is to bring attention to the things that have been changed."

msgid "Introduce a function to check that the specified value is of UUID type (gh-5171). Read more: :ref:`uuid.is_uuid() <uuid-is_uuid>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "A new function ``space:alter(options)`` to change some space settings without recreation nor touching ``_space`` space. Read more: :doc:`/reference/reference_lua/box_space/alter`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Composite types extraction is now supported in key_def (gh-4538)."

msgid "upserts now follow associative property: the result of several upserts doesn’t depend on the order of their application (gh-5105);"
msgstr ""

msgid "upserts referring to -1 fieldno are handled correctly now (gh-5087)."
msgstr ""

msgid "there’s no more upserts squash procedure: upserts referring to the same field with arithmetic operations are not merged into one operation since resulting upsert might not be applied - as a result both upserts would be ignored (meanwhile only one should be)."

msgid "LuaJIT"
msgstr ""

msgid "**[Breaking change]** Introduce LuaJIT platform metrics (gh-5187). Read more: :ref:`LuaJIT metrics <metrics-luajit>`."

msgstr ""

msgid "SQL"
msgstr ""

msgid "SQL views are not alterable anymore. Beforehand it led to the undefined behaviour."

msgid "XlogGapError is not a critical error anymore. It means, box.info.replication will show upstream status as ‘loading’ if the error was found. The upstream will be restarted until the error is resolved automatically with a help of another instance, or until the replica is removed from box.cfg.replication (gh-5287)."
