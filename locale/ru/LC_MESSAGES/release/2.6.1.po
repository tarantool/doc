msgid ""
"Transactional manager for the memtx engine that allows yielding in "

"Raft-based automated failover mechanism for a single-leader replica set. "
"Replica set can be configured to provide automated leader election and "
"failover. Accompanied with synchronous replication it brings data safety and"

msgid ""
"There are changes labeled with **[Breaking change]**. It means that the old "
"behavior was considered error-prone and therefore changed to protect users "
"from unintended mistakes. However, there is a little probability that "
"someone can lean on the old behavior, and this label is to bring attention "
"to the things that have been changed."

"Fixed fibers switch-over to prevent JIT machinery misbehavior. Trace "
"recording is aborted when fiber yields the execution. The yield occurring "
