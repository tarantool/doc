"<index_parts_declaration_note>`."

":ref:`Bitset index <indexes-bitset>` now supports the varbinary type "
"(:tarantool-issue:`5392`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Index-related options now can’t be specified in their definition due to a "
"more pedantic key-parts verification (:tarantool-issue:`5473`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A warning is now logged when schema version is older than last available "
"schema version (:tarantool-issue:`4574`)."

msgid "LuaJIT"
