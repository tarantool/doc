msgid "C stored procedures"
msgstr ""

msgid "Tarantool can call C code with :ref:`modules <app_server-modules>`, or with :ref:`ffi <cookbook-ffi_printf>`, or with C stored procedures. This tutorial only is about the third option, C stored procedures. In fact the routines are always \"C functions\" but the phrase \"stored procedure\" is commonly used for historical reasons."
msgstr ""

msgid "In this tutorial, which can be followed by anyone with a Tarantool development package and a C compiler, there are five tasks:"
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`easy.c <f_c_tutorial-easy>` -- prints \"hello world\";"
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`harder.c <f_c_tutorial-harder>` -- decodes a passed parameter value;"

msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`write.c <f_c_tutorial-write>` -- uses the C API to do a DBMS replace."

msgstr ""

msgid "Both ``module.h`` and ``msgpuck.h`` must be on the include path for the C compiler to see them. For example, if ``module.h`` address is ``/usr/local/include/tarantool/module.h``, and ``msgpuck.h`` address is ``/usr/local/include/msgpuck/msgpuck.h``, and they are not currently on the include path, say:"

msgid "The ``libmsgpuck.a`` static library is necessary with msgpuck versions produced after February 2017. If and only if you encounter linking problems when using the gcc statements in the examples for this tutorial, you should put ``libmsgpuck.a`` on the path (``libmsgpuck.a`` is produced from both msgpuck and Tarantool source downloads so it should be easy to find). For example, instead of \":code:`gcc -shared -o harder.so -fPIC harder.c`\" for the second example below, you will need to say \":code:`gcc -shared -o harder.so -fPIC harder.c libmsgpuck.a`\"."

msgstr ""

msgid "At this point the ``harder()`` function will start using functions defined in `msgpuck.h <https://github.com/tarantool/msgpuck>`_. The routines that begin with \"mp\" are msgpuck functions that handle data formatted according to the MsgPack_ specification. Passes and returns are always done with this format so one must become acquainted with msgpuck to become proficient with the C API."
msgstr ""

msgid "For now, though, it's enough to know that ``mp_decode_array()`` returns the number of elements in an array, and ``mp_decode_uint`` returns an unsigned integer, from :code:`args`. And there's a side effect: when the decoding finishes, :code:`args` has changed and is now pointing to the next element."
msgstr ""

msgid "Therefore the first displayed line will be \"arg_count = 1\" because there was only one item passed: ``passable_table``. |br| The second displayed line will be \"field_count = 3\" because there are three items in the table. |br| The next three lines will be \"1\" and \"2\" and \"3\" because those are the values in the items in the table."
