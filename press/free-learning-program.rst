        <h1>Tarantool Launches Free Learning Programs: In-Memory NoSQL for Smart Caching, RESTful APIs, Microservices and More</h1>
        <p>Mountain View, CA (Newswire.com) -- &#8203;In response to a survey of DBAs and Enterprise Architects, Tarantool is
          launching a new program to allow rapid self-learning. </p>
        <p>The program is self-driven and in just a few steps, introduces concepts necessary for rapid and successful deployment
          of in-memory data grid for APIs, microservices, and to scale applications. This includes in-memory NoSQL for Smart
          Caching, RESTful APIs and Microservices, MySQL Integration, and more. </p>
        <p>Tarantool’s General Manager, Dennis Anikin, stated that “The feedback from our users was clear- they wanted us to help
          to solve common problems quickly. This included: 1. Breaking down monolithic apps into scalable RESTful APIs and
          microservices, 2. Smarter and faster caching, and 3. Speeding up databases like Oracle and MySQL. Our education program
          to address these goals is beginning with our release of quick tutorial guides. Over the coming months this will include
          videos as well. This way, people can learn how they want, when they want.” </p>
        <p>“The goal of this effort is so our community can have a streamlined adoption experience and get the maximum impact
          out of the technology,” added Tyler Norkus, Director for Tarantool. </p>
