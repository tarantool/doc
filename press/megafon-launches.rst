        <h1>MegaFon Launches Tarantool-Based Equipment and Connection Quality Control System</h1>

        <p>Mountain View, CA (Newswire.com) -- ​MegаFon launched a system that leverages the
          <a href="http://tarantool.io/">Tarantool</a> database management system, in order to increase productivity for streaming data processing along with
          automated statistical data collection from a million base station sectors. Data collection for further storage and
          processing is performed in near real-time.
        </p>

        <p>Several thousand metrics are collected from each sector of the base station: connectivity quality, number of connection
          faults, Internet connection speed, as well as other parameters that determine the technical integrity of the station.
          Tarantool was selected for the MegaFon project because this DBMS is capable of processing large amount of data both
          in memory and via magnetic disk-based storage systems. Other industrial-class DBMSs only support SSDs for this load
          level, and SSDs are approximately 8–10 times more expensive than magnetic disks.
        </p>

        <p>The system will be used for analysis as well as automating network monitoring. Various scenarios have been worked out
          in order to increase connection quality and cut costs associated with operation of the telecom operator’s ground
          infrastructure. These scenarios include automated creation of applications for equipment configuration modification
          in case of insufficient capacity or deterioration of connection quality in specific locations, as well as predicting
          the best time for scheduling maintenance of the base station.
        </p>

        <p>Dennis Anikin, General Manager of Tarantool said that “Implementation of Tarantool in MegaFon was a long and meticulous
          process involving a large number of professionals on both sides. We’re happy that MegaFon saw the true value of our
          product. We’re now further strengthening our positions in conventional industries: telecommunications, banking, retail,
          as well as various industrial segments. The evolution of Tarantool allowed for the extensive spread of our solution,
          from data centers to Industrial IoT.” ​
        </p>

        <p>“We always strive to provide the best connection quality for our customers, and that is why it is so important to have
          the tools for real time operations monitoring across our network. Tarantool’s performance enables us to speed up
          the input data stream processing as well as to create a real time decision making system — e. g. collecting statistical
          data from the ground facilities where millions of devices must be covered,” says Vladimir Savkin, MegaFon CIO. ​
