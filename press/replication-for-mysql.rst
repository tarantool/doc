                <h1>Tarantool DBMS Now Supports Replication from MySQL</h1>
                <p>Tarantool developers have revealed a MySQL-to-Tarantool replication system designed to decrease the workload on MySQL databases.
                </p>

                <p>The replication mechanism enables users to automatically synchronize data between the two databases. A single Tarantool server can handle the workload that can challenge 20 MySQL servers. The MySQL administrator cuts the workload on the servers by rerouting read requests to Tarantool.

                </p>
                <p>The system is designed for companies heavily relying on MySQL to both save on hardware and development costs, and speed up their mobile and web-based applications.</p>

                <p>
                    <span style="">“Migrating to a new DBMS often calls for serious changes to the existing infrastructure.
                    Tarantool’s new replication system might be a solution for those who are not yet ready to take this
                    step: by taking advantage of Tarantool’s functionality, companies will only need to make a few slight
                    tweaks to their infrastructure. Any business actively using MySQL can easily set up MySQL-to-Tarantool replication
                    to increase performance and expedite request processing.
                    Yota, the broadband services provider and smartphone manufacturer, recently deployed an Oracle-to-Tarantool
                    replication mechanism, which has significantly improved the speed of their services and reduced the workload
                    on their Oracle servers. They are now using replicating data from the two most popular DBMSs in the world:
                        Oracle and MySQL,”</span> commented Dennis Anikin, General Manager of Tarantool.
                </p>

                <p>Tarantool now supports replication from MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, DB2, and any source can be configured or added for clients to support their environment and schemas.
                </p>
