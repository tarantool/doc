                <h1>Veon Migrates Their Online Services to Tarantool</h1>
                <p><a href="http://www.vimpelcom.com/">Veon</a>, an international communications company and the owner of the Beeline brand, is deploying Tarantool database management system (DBMS) for processing online data. Tarantool was selected to make access to billing information tens of times faster, allow for better interactivity of end-user services (including access to personal accounts) and help with shaping better service offers for subscribers depending on their consumer profile. The head contractor for deploying is AT Consulting.</p>

                <p>Tarantool is the basis for a data virtualization platform and a number of related applications that were specially developed. The key features of this platform include subsystems for data versioning and load balancing. This allows to optimize interaction with traditional databases and virtually any other sources, no matter what their interface is like.
                </p>

                <p>Vladimir Savkin, CIO: "Migration to Tarantool will accelerate the web interface of personal accounts, speed up access to many online services, including parental control, and allow for quicker end-user operations like getting balance information, receiving sms notifications and choosing tariff parameters. Moreover, thanks to the ability to analyze our subscribers' mobile Internet consumption, we'll be able to shape more relevant service offers. Tarantool's high speed of transaction processing and friendly development interface will let us cut our hardware and license costs as well as shorten the time for introducing a number of new data processing features."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Vladimir Gabrielyan, Vice President and CTO: "We have been using Tarantool for many years in our own projects, and we know that it's an optimal tool for a business with complex infrastructure. Our database with an application server onboard ensures high speed of data processing and great throughput, still keeping the costs on budget. We're pleased that Veon has become a flagship telecommunications customers where Tarantool can show its best efficiency and impact."
